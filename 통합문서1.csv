Although nationalism was the preserve of the South Korean right wing from the trusteeship crisis in 1945 through the end of the Park Chung Hee regime, a historiographical revolt in the 1980s that emphasized the historical illegitimacy of the South Korean state allowed the Left to appropriate nationalism. With the loss of nationalism from its arsenal, the Right turned to postnationalist neoliberal discourse to blunt the effectiveness of leftist nationalist rhetoric. An examination of New Right historiography on the colonial and postliberation periods, however, shows that despite the recent change in conservatives' stance on nationalism, a preoccupation with the legitimacy of the South Korean state remains at the center of right-wing historical narratives. The New Right represents old wine in new bottles.","[Yang, Sungik] Harvard Univ, Hist & East Asian Languages, Dept East Asian Languages & Civilizat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Yang, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Hist & East Asian Languages, Dept East Asian Languages & Civilizat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sungikyang@g.harvard.edu,,"Yang, Sungik/0000-0002-6303-8992",Korea Institute of Harvard University; Academy of Korean Studies; International Center for Korean Studies at the Kyujanggak Institute of Seoul National University,Korea Institute of Harvard University; Academy of Korean Studies; International Center for Korean Studies at the Kyujanggak Institute of Seoul National University,"I would like to thank Professors Carter Eckert, Sun Joo Kim, and Andrew Gordon for their insights, expertise, and guidance throughout the process of research and publication.

Such events were not uncommon, and, when they occurred, policy makers in Seoul worked to mitigate any negative effects so that stability could be maintained in inter-Korean relations. Recently, however, the issue of human rights has become salient and has had the effect of injecting uncertainty into inter-Korean relations. This may seem somewhat strange since human rights is a positive force in international affairs and most often resisted only by target states and their allies who find such targeting a threat. Despite this, both North and South Korea resisted the targeting of North Korea as a human rights abuser, and this article explains why. Specifically, it shows that Seoul's resistance should have been expected because promoting a human rights agenda in North Korea injects uncertainty into inter-Korean relations and potentially undermines the relative stability that has existed on the peninsula throughout the postwar period.","[Patterson, Dennis P.; Choi, Jangsup] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Patterson, DP (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",den-nis.patterson@ttu.edu; jangsup.choi@ttu.edu,,,,,,,19,0,1,0,7,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,WIN,2008,39,4,,,,,631,656,,,,,,26,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; International Relations,389TE,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000262116600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Munshins could only be seen on Korean gangsters just a few decades ago, but today, increasingly more young Korean people are getting fashionable tattoos like a butterfly or a cross on easily visible parts of their body. The aim of this article is to examine the changing tattoo culture in Korea and find out what it reveals about Korean society, South Korean attitudes about individualism, globalization and modernity, and how these attitudes are related to local and global issues. Based on discourse analysis, field research and interviews, the results indicate that tattoos on the bodies of Korean youth are a fashion statement, expression of self and signs of social change. As the country develops economically and makes further global advancements, Korean society is changing towards expression of individuality, a higher interest in appearance and stronger competition.","[Park, Judy] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Text Merchandising & Fash Design, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Text Merchandising & Fash Design, 1st Floor,Bldg 222,Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul, South Korea.",judy5134@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1470-3572,1741-3214,,VISUAL COMMUN-US,Vis.

Pro-North Korean sentiments are proposed to be highest among those who feel a stronger sense of common ancestry and language with North Koreans, the wealthy, the younger, those who trust NGOs, those in Seoul and those in the southwest region. I use ordered logistical regression to test hypotheses derived from these propositions. I find support for the southwest hypothesis, though the percentage of South Koreans with these sentiments is actually very low.

Using sources ranging from economic reports to defector testimonies and field research in both South and North Korea, the article shows that despite largely different economic and political paths, the two Koreas have developed toy markets that address shared histories. The article suggests that conflict toys can perform an important function in inter-Korean relations: they allow the two Koreas to experience and potentially transcend the status quo. The article further argues that both Koreas can polarise their populations quickly through a controlled propaganda machine in the North, and an omnipresent globalised culture in the South: in both cases, a political message of either conflict or reconciliation could reach many children quickly via toys, and thus be a driver for change for anyone who was willing to use such levers.","[Grzelczyk, Virginie] Aston Univ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Grzelczyk, V (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",v.grzelczyk@aston.ac.uk,"Grzelczyk, Virginie/H-3579-2014","Grzelczyk, Virginie M/0000-0001-9802-7161",Leverhulme Research Fellowship [RF-2018-635\8],Leverhulme Research Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust),This research as well as the field work in the ROK and DPRK has been supported by a Leverhulme Research Fellowship for the year 2018-2019 (Reference RF-2018-635\8).,,66,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

North Korea was dissatisfied with the Jiandao Treaty of 1909, but was uneasy about raising that dissatisfaction with the Chinese in the 1950s. When China was caught in a number of woeful domestic and international predicaments in 1962, Pyongyang seized the opportunity and proposed to Beijing that the border issue be settled. It took the two sides only six months to negotiate and sign a new boundary treaty. As a result, North Korea emerged with a larger share of Tianchi and other disputed areas.","[Shen, Zhihua; Xia, Yafeng] E China Normal Univ, Ctr Cold War Int Hist Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yafeng] Long Isl Univ, Brookville, NY USA",East China Normal University; Long Island University; Long Island University Post,"Shen, ZH (corresponding author), E China Normal Univ, Ctr Cold War Int Hist Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",shenzhihua0420@vip.sina.com; yafeng.xia@liu.edu,,,,,,,42,6,6,2,12,"KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES",SEOUL,"28-42 SAMCHUNG-DONG, CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-230, SOUTH KOREA",0258-9184,,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,JAN-MAR,2013,37,1,,,,,1,30,,,,,,30,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,099FK,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000315606600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the late 1980s, the economic situations of Koreans in Brazil have slowly deteriorated. Many successful Koreans who accumulated sufficient wealth abandoned Brazil to took for economic opportunities elsewhere. Some non-affluent Koreans who failed to adjust to Brazilian society also did not find bright futures in Brazil. Some Korean immigrants in Brazil decided to return to their homeland, the economy of which has grown much faster than Brazil's since the 1980s.

The future of Korea is of great concern to Russia both because of the Korean peninsula's geostrategic importance and South Korea's alliance relationship with the United States. This article addresses three primary questions: (i) How has Russia's Korea policy evolved over the years? (ii) What position does Russia take on North Korea's nuclear ambitions? and (iii) Will Russia support Korean unification? Russia professes its support for Korean unification. But there are important caveats. Given all the caveats, Russia will be neither active nor positive in supporting Korean unification, especially since it is likely to be achieved on South Korean terms. Will Russia then tolerate a Korean unification, which is likely to follow the German model of the South's absorption of the North? Under the right circumstances, Russia might. In the German case, Mikhail Gorbachev as the Soviet leader and the cooperative relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union were the keys to the smooth sailing to Germany's unification in 1989-1990. As with the German case, the state of US-Russia relations and the type of leader in the Kremlin will prove the most crucial factors in Russia's acceptance or non-acceptance of a unified Korea. In this article, the author argues that Russia's interests in and policy toward the Korean peninsula have been consistent over the years in two important ways. First, Russia opposes any power's dominance in Korea. Second, Russia prefers a status quo on the Korean peninsula to a Korean unification. The author also argues that Russia will acquiesce to North Korea's status as a de facto nuclear weapons state for lack of a viable alternative.",,,,,,,,,,,45,5,5,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

While North Korea has succeeded in getting the United States to the negotiation table by using the nuclear card and consolidating its own regime security, the process of resolving the issue has been locked in a cycle of negotiation, agreement, abrogation of agreements, the heightening of crisis, and renegotiation. Thus, whereas the Six-Party Talks have yielded agreements to end North Korea's nuclear programs, notably through the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement and the February 13 Agreement of 2007, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program. It is therefore clear that the North Korean nuclear issue is showing little, if any, sign of being resolved despite pressure from the international community, including the South Korean government's suspension of economic assistance and cooperation with the North, and the UN Security Council sanctions against the North. This paper accordingly examines the North Korean nuclear issue-the most pressing security problem on the Korean Peninsula during the past two decades. This paper explores the recurring pattern of the North Korean nuclear crises and North Korea's negotiating behavior, analyzing the core and critical issues of dealing with the North Korean nuclear program and the difficulties that have arisen in the process. In so doing, policy priorities are identified that could help to bring about a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula.","Chung Ang Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Yun-Young, C (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",yycho@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,12,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

With up to approximately 1 million overseas Koreans residing in Korea out of a total of 7.08 million, issues related to immigration to Korea are also pertinent. The burgeoning population of overseas Koreans and their demands not only affect the central government's policies but also impact local communities. This article aims to explore how the Korean society is legally and institutionally responding to the recent surge in the population of overseas Koreans within Korea. To achieve this goal, the article focuses on three aspects. First, it analyzes the increase in the population of overseas Koreans in Korean society over the past two decades along with the associated issues from the perspectives of immigration, ethnicity, overseas Koreans, laws and institutions, and central and local governments. Second, it examines the new laws, institutions, and the interrelationship between the government and overseas Koreans that have been developed to address the issues raised.

More recently, there has been an evolution in South Korean nationalism that is based on strikingly different notions particularly among young people. This paper argues that a new South Korean nationalism is emerging and that it has, what I term, globalised cultural characteristics. These characteristics challenge the role of ethnicity in young people's conception of the South Korean nation and its component members. This paper details the evolution of South Korea's nationalism and explains its implications for Korean politics and society as well as its comparative significance for other national contexts. It also highlights some elements of this evolving nationalism that demonstrate less cosmopolitan characteristics, such as patriarchy and social class, in determining who can be imagined' as a member of this changing South Korean nation.","Australian Natl Univ, Strateg & Def Studies Ctr, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Campbell, E (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Strateg & Def Studies Ctr, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,Korea Foundation; Australian Endeavour Cheung Kong Research Fellowship; Australia-Korea Foundation,"Korea Foundation; Australian Endeavour Cheung Kong Research Fellowship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australia-Korea Foundation","The author would like to acknowledge and thank Professor Ed Aspinall for his comments on an earlier draft and Professor Paul Hutchcroft for his supervision of the Ph.D. research which led to this article.

This interview is unique not only because it became Roh's last interview conducted before his suicide on May 23, 2009, but also because it provides Roh's candid critical self-assessment on his own presidency, especially regarding his role in both domestic politics and the inter-Korean relationship, and the Korea-US relationship during his term in office, as well as commenting on Japan's approach to Northeast Asian regional politics. Reflecting on Roh's star-like rise to the presidency and fall from grace, this commentary alerts readers that Roh's last interview needs to be considered within the context of the Roh Moo-Hyun Phenomenon, especially in regard to the 2017 presidential election, because it will directly affect the fate of not just the pro-Roh group, with the largest share of the opposition in today's Korean society, but the Korean people as a whole at a time when the country's many leading civic groups are desperately seeking a Great Transformation.","[Kim, Hyung-A] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Kim, HA (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Hyunga.Kim@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,7,8,8,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0047-2336,1752-7554,,J CONTEMP ASIA,J.

During this time span, Korean academic circles and journals have undergone various changes, which resulted in the transformation of both the journals and their surrounding environment. With due consideration of these changes, this paper attempts to investigate the significance and agendas of English-language journals in Korean Studies. First, it investigates why Korean intellectuals felt the need to learn English during the modern transitional period by examining the case of Yu Gil-jun. It then examines the initial goals of English-language magazines and journals in Korea. In the early phase, these publications tended to deliver one-way statements, almost sounding like publicity pitches, but they gradually took on the facade of an arena of scholarly discussion and output. The now defunct Pictorial Korea began publication following national liberation to inform the world about Korea by using photographs accompanied by brief texts. Korea Journal, which began publication immediately following the May 16 Coup (1961) for the prospective readership of overseas Koreans as well as foreigners, has transformed itself multiple times over the years and acquired the characteristics of a specialized academic journal. Seoul Journal of Korean Studies, which began publication following the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics, initially took the approach of transmitting to the world research outcomes in Korean Studies in Korea. English-language journals published in Korea are expected to play a role in the advancement of Korean scholarship. This is because they can serve as a sphere of symbiosis and debate between Korean Studies inside and outside Korea. It is particularly hoped the journals will contribute to complementing or overcoming the closedness of the disciplinary system of the Korean academy.","[Hwang, Jae-moon] Seoul Natl Univ, Kyujanggak Inst Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Hwang, JM (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Kyujanggak Inst Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",hwajm@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,5,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,FAL,2021,61,3,,,,,15,38,,10.25024/kj.2021.61.3.15,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2021.61.3.15,,,24,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,WB5IT,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000703606100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

President Park Chung-hee, who came to power in a military coup, did not pay much attention to unification matters in his early rule, but starting from the late 1960s, Park gradually began to change his North Korea policy due to a combination of external and internal conditions. I intend to explain the causes of Seoul's new approach toward Pyongyang through three variables: Threat perception, regime characteristics, and the distribution of power. A combination of these factors forced the Park regime to change its North Korea policy from confrontation to cooperation. However, inter-Korean cooperation proved to be short-lived. The early demise of rapprochement can be explained by the absence of compelling forces that could have driven the deepening of cooperation between the two parties.","Kyung Hee Univ, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Woo, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Yongin, South Korea.",sjwoo@khu.ac.kr,,"Woo, Seongji/0000-0002-6432-7112",,,,,28,2,2,0,1,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SUM,2009,49,2,,,,,37,58,,,,,,22,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,471AG,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000268023400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The issue of conscientious objection in Korea has extended from a religious and philosophical field to a political, diplomatic, and international problem, being influenced heavily by IRFR and UNHRC.

They sided with North Korea and Roh Moo-hyun in their stress on insufficient South Korean vigilance in dealing with collaborators and the legacy of Japan's occupation. Mainstream Chinese coverage of the Korean War ignores who invaded and why in order to emphasize the US entry into the war as an imperialist aggressor and China's just involvement.

Among the valuable factors, the most significant is that traditional Korean archery Gukgung instructors taught several archers in the early stages of their success. There are many similar shooting techniques in archery adopted from traditional techniques, including levelling one's arms, releasing the string, taking one's arm back to the rear and aiming according to the wind direction.

J,"Kim, DJ",,,,"Kim, Dong Jin",,,Aid to the enemy: linking development and peacebuilding on the Korean peninsula,PACIFIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conflict sensitive development; strategic peacebuilding; North Korea; South Korea; Korean conflict,,"This article discusses the link between development and peacebuilding to analyze South Korean aid activities in North Korea in the context of the Korean conflict, where there are deep-rooted cycles of conflict episodes, and to explore the possibility of aid for peace on the Korean peninsula in the future. The Korean conflict is a large part of what makes South Korean aid to North Korea ineffective. For the past 20 years, South Korean aid to North Korea has fluctuated greatly, due to the context of the Korean conflict. The Korean conflict, once seemingly on the way to resolution, appears to have reverted to a time before the end of the Cold War. Many people in both the North and the South still see each other as the enemy. Most of the South Korean aid projects in North Korea have been suspended indefinitely and the fluctuation of aid to North Korea caused serious debates within South Korean society. At one point, the debates grew so heated that they were called the South-South conflict'. Building on the conceptual framework of conflict sensitive development and strategic peacebuilding, this article argues that, to overcome the current impasse, all stakeholders must better understand the context of the Korean conflict and the interaction between the context and themselves, and develop a comprehensive strategy together, to encompass the multiple issues raised by the Korean conflict, as strategic peacebuilding proposes.","[Kim, Dong Jin] Peace Culture Inst Korea, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Dong Jin] Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea",,"Kim, DJ (corresponding author), 218 Dokseodang Ro,Samsung APT 107-1702, Seoul 133758, South Korea.",5241jin@hanmail.net,"KIM, DONG JIN/ABG-8653-2020","Kim, Dong Jin/0000-0002-8157-2769",,,,,55,11,12,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

As an unintended consequence of hallyu, such nationalism enables non-Korean hallyu fans to take on the empowering roles of cultural experts, educators, and even cultural ambassadors to promote Korea abroad. The symbolic shift from diasporic to hallyu nationalism brings to the fore nonnationalist, nonessentialist, and transcultural perspectives in fandom studies. In tracing the history of Korea Day from the 2000s to the 2010s, I found that hallyu fan-students are mobilized both by the macro mission to promote a positive image of Korea in their home societies and by the micro motivation to repair their own, often stigmatized, self-image.","[Lyan, Irina] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Lyan, I (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",irina.lyan@mail.huji.ac.il,"Lyan, Irina/ABA-2499-2021","Lyan, Irina/0000-0001-7675-8713",,,,,41,7,7,2,40,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

In order to survive the sanctions, North Korea needs to entrap China to its side, for the North Korean economy is highly dependent upon China. In this context, this article argues that North Korea intentionally increases the level of its nuclear and missile threat in order to entrap China (thus, reducing its fear of being abandoned by China). That is, North Korea has elaborated its coercive diplomacy in order to press China to show a strong commitment to their mutual alliance. In order to develop the above argument, this article proceeds as follows. First, as an analytical framework, it applies Glenn Snyder's concept of the linkage between the alliance game and adversary game to the trilateral relationship among the United States (along with South Korea), China and North Korea. Second, it provides an overview of Sino-North Korean relations from 2006 up to the present, attempting to analyze North Korea's brinkmanship. Thirdly, it concludes with some policy implications for future trilateral relations, one of which is that China should seriously discuss North Korea contingency plans with the United States and South Korea in order to develop an effective strategy to curb North Korea's military adventurism. Paradoxically, this would lead to North Korea's fully considering China's position.","[Park, Hongseo] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Inst Chinese Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Jae Jeok] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Park, H (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Inst Chinese Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",hongseo@hanmail.net; jjpark@hufs.ac.kr,"Park, Jae Jeok/JHU-9053-2023",,,,,,61,9,9,0,22,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

However, limited agricultural activity was allowed in the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ) surrounding the DMZ. In this study, land cover and vegetation changes in the western DMZ and CCZ from 1919 to 2017 were investigated. Coniferous forests were nearly completely destroyed during the war and were then converted to deciduous forests by ecological succession. Plains in the DMZ and CCZ areas showed different patterns of land cover changes. In the DMZ, pre-war rice paddies were gradually transformed into grasslands. These grasslands have not returned to forest, and this may be explained by wildfires set for military purposes or hydrological fluctuations in floodplains. Grasslands near the floodplains in the DMZ are highly valued for conservation as a rare land type. Most grasslands in the CCZ were converted back to rice paddies, consistent with their previous use. After the 1990s, ginseng cultivation in the CCZ increased. In addition, the landscape changes in the Korean DMZ and CCZ were affected by political circumstances between South and North Korea. Our results provide baseline information for the development of ecosystem management and conservation plans for the Korean DMZ and CCZ. Given the high biodiversity and ecological integrity of the Korean DMZ region, transboundary governance for conservation should be designed.","[Kim, Jae Hyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Jae Hyun; Park, Shinyeong; Kim, Seung Ho] DMZ Ecol Res Inst, Paju 10881, South Korea; [Kim, Jae Hyun; Lee, Eun Ju] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, EJ (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",rlawogus36@snu.ac.kr; ecosy@snu.ac.kr; ecodmz@dmz.or.kr; ejlee@snu.ac.kr,"; Park, Shinyeong/JHT-7128-2023; Kim, Hyung/J-5451-2012; Kim, Jae Hyun/AGW-2214-2022","Kim, Jae Hyun/0000-0003-0361-9223; Park, Shinyeong/0000-0002-6604-3404;",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B4006761],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B4006761].,,61,6,7,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUL,2021,10,7,,,,,,,708,10.3390/land10070708,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10070708,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TN6PT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000676355100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper describes important aspects of Korean life in Central Asia that have been relatively undermined by many scholars in international relations and anthropology. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the history and meaning of the settlement of Korean people in Russia and Central Asia from a multitude of perspectives. Despite the size of the Korean population and its significant contributions to the building of Soviet society, very little has been written about Koreans in the former Soviet Union. In fact, the ethnic Korean group has been one of the largest minority groups in the former Soviet Union, representing an important element of both Soviet and post-Soviet political, social, ethnic, and economic history. This study revealed, once again, the tragic story of Stalin's deportation of Kan people in Russia and explored an intriguing analysis of the re-encounter of Korean and Turkish people after a millennium and their long, intimate cultural bond. In particular, this study demonstrated that the historical and cultural affinities between Koreans and Central Asians existed long before Stalin's deportation. Political, economic, social, and linguistic exchanges between Korean people and Turkic people are deeply rooted in the same mythology of Dangun, the legendary founder of the first Korean kingdom of Gojoseon. This reflects the dynamics of success of the Korean people in the former Soviet Union as well as their mutual interest in enhancing relations between Korea and the Turkic states and Siberian region.","[Ahn, Se Hyun] Univ Seoul, Dept Int Relat, Seoulsiripdaero 163, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Ahn, SH (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Dept Int Relat, Seoulsiripdaero 163, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",ahns@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0021-9096,1745-2538,,J ASIAN AFR STUD,J.

South Korea, the primary target of North Korean nuclear development and strategy, should extend its deterrent, offensive, and defensive capabilities, which are three general types of preparedness for ordinary nations. Seoul should specifically strengthen its capabilities to retaliate against the North Korean leadership. It should also develop a plan to neutralize North Korean nuclear weapons in case of either an imminent or actual North Korean nuclear offense.

The former Soviet Union had participated in the Korean War and its Air Force supported the communist forces on the ground. Moscow was the major donor in the reconstruction of postwar North Korea. The North Korean nuclear program had been initiated with Soviet equipment and training of nuclear scientists. Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. All of these factors make Russia one of the countries with the most influence over North Korea. However, after Moscow had established diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea in 1990, there were ups and downs in the relations between Russia and North Korea. First, the period from 1990 to 1995 was the worst time for Russia-North Korea relations. Second, Russia's influence was regained after the new treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation with the North was signed. Moreover, the first trip for a Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, to North Korea was made in 2000. Third, since the beginning of the second North Korean nuclear crisis in 2002, Russia became an active participant in the Six-Party Talks. Russia realized that a balanced diplomacy toward the two Koreas works better for the interests of Russia rather than the pro-South Korean stance in the first few years of the early 1990s. In the 2000s, the overall relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang has improved. The railway connections of the TSR and TKR, and the construction of oil and gas pipelines through the Korean peninsula have been under discussion among Russia, North Korea, and South Korea. However, the process has been slow. The author has interviewed the former South Korean ambassadors to Russia in order to gain first-hand knowledge of Russia-North Korean relations. As to the overall Moscow-Pyongyang relations, the author shares the same views as the Russian experts about South Korea. However, they emphasized one particular point-North Korea's debt to Russia. This was an issue that was rarely discussed in South Korea. In June 2012, Russia announced that 90 percent of the North Korean debt could possibly be written off. If the Russian initiative is approved, North Korea could join and initiate new projects with Russia. The Seoul government should be able to join the trilateral cooperation among Russia, North Korea, and South Korea. The Ambassadors' advice needs to be taken seriously.","Kyonggi Univ, Suwon, South Korea",Kyonggi University,"Kim, DJ (corresponding author), Kyonggi Univ, Suwon, South Korea.",dougkim@kyonggi.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,5,6,1,15,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Recent decades have seen a South Korean debate between drawing closer to the U.S. or balancing more evenly between the U.S. and China, alongside a U.S. debate over remaining strongly engaged abroad or pulling back from international commitments. After the end of the Cold War, in a relatively non-threatening, permissive international environment, these approaches could be tried in various forms and combinations without fundamentally altering bilateral relations. In the New Era ushered in by Xi Jinping's China, South Korean and U.S. leaders must make starker, more binary choices between moving closer or farther apart. Moving closer makes more sense and looks more likely.","[Horowitz, Shale] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Horowitz, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",shale@uwm.edu,,,,,,,46,0,0,1,1,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SPR,2025,56,1,,,,,51,75,,10.29152/KOIKS.2025.56.1.51,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2025.56.1.51,,,25,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,1WD7R,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001475081300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method We analyzed 8524 participants' data obtained from the 2008 to 2016 waves of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospective cohort study. Depression was diagnosed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale: 10-Items (CES-D10), with scores of 4 or higher indicating depression. We used a generalized estimating equation and a cross-lagged panel model for statistical analysis. Results Participants who had not traveled for one year had a 71% higher risk of suffering from depression in the following year than did those who had traveled [relative risk (RR) = 1.71, P < 0.001], and participants with depression had more than double the increased risk of not traveling than did those not currently suffering from depression (RR = 2.08, P < 0.001). The cross-lagged panel model confirmed the vicious cycle involving the amount of travel and score on the CES-D10; individuals who traveled more frequently were more likely to have lower scores on the CES-D10 (coefficient = - 0.04 to - 0.03, Ps < 0.01), and individuals with higher scores were less likely to travel (coefficient = - 0.06 to - 0.03, Ps < 0.01). Conclusions The risk of depression increases for people who do not travel, and a reciprocal relationship exists between travel and depression.","[Hyun, Seungjae; Park, Sangshin] Univ Seoul, Grad Sch Urban Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Hyun, Seungjae; Park, Sangshin] Univ Seoul, Dept Urban Big Data Convergence, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Yeonjin] Kookmin Univ, Dept Sociol, 77 Jeongreung Ro, Seoul, South Korea",University of Seoul; University of Seoul; Kookmin University,"Lee, Y (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Dept Sociol, 77 Jeongreung Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",yjinlee@kookmin.ac.kr,"; Park, Sangshin/K-6889-2014","lee, yeonjin/0000-0002-9438-4724;",,,,,30,8,8,2,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-859X,,ANN GEN PSYCHIATR,Ann.

However, it might be more accurate to say that it is what the unique Korean religious mind has manifested and transformed in the framework of particular religious traditions during a particular time. In a time of modernization, the concept of Korean religion above all has become largely reduced and purified through social differentiation. It has also become popularized and has taken on distinctively global traits beyond its Asian provincialism. Korean Religious Studies in its process of becoming concretized since the 20th century has regarded the aspects of Korean Religion such as basic religiosity, universality formed through comparison, and indigenous peculiarity as its core research themes. In the future, we can expect that Korean Religious Studies will actively share a horizon of comparison with studies that are based on religious experiences of East Asian countries including China and Japan. Moreover, it will participate in the restructuring of world religious studies, while at the same time pursuing a more profound identity of Korean Religion.","[Kim, Chongsuh] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Kim, Chongsuh] Acad Korean Studies, Songnam, South Korea; [Kim, Chongsuh] Korean Assoc Hist Relig, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Academy of Korean Studies,"Kim, C (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",chongsuh@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,11,6,10,0,8,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

Throughout this period, women's parliamentary representation in South Korea lagged severely behind women's share of the voting population, a gap that may have stemmed from public perceptions that unlike their male counterparts, women members of parliament (MPs) are underqualified. But are they really underqualified? Drawing upon the biographies of all MPs to have served in the KNA until 2020, this study finds KNA women parliamentarians' educational qualifications, ages, and incumbency rates to have risen considerably over time with women now more likely to hold advanced academic degrees than their male counterparts. Hence, this study concludes that although women in the Korean National Assembly may to a certain extent be differently qualified than male legislators, they can no longer be said to be underqualified compared to male MPs.","[Joshi, Devin K.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Joshi, DK (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore.",devinjoshi@smu.edu.sg,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,2,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,,2021,52,3,,,,,461,482,,10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.3.461,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.3.461,,,22,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,YK3AM,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000745090200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas most survey studies have focused on the demographic factors influencing the usage of TKM, only a few studies have conducted a pattern or trend analysis over time. The purpose of this paper is to observe and document recent trends in the usage of TKM in South Korea and to compare overall patterns of TKM use over a period of several years. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 to assess TKM usage patterns and public perceptions regarding TKM. An online questionnaire was administered to consenting respondents that focused upon individual preferences between TKM and current Western medicine, respondents' reasons for using TKM, the frequency of respondents' visits to TKM clinics, the reasons respondents visited TKM clinics, and respondents' perceived satisfaction. Results: The results revealed that 66.6% of the respondents showed a positive attitude toward TKM. In addition, 69.3% of the respondents had visited TKM clinics one to four times during the previous year. Patients used TKM with the intentions of receiving acupuncture (95.3%), moxibustion (40.1%), and cupping (36.0%) treatments or to take herbal medicines (35.7%). Most respondents who had visited TKM clinics were largely satisfied with the clinics' effectiveness (56.1%). The factors most commonly associated with TKM usage included sex (female), age (50s), and education (college or higher), but the within-factor differences were not significant. Compared with a previous survey of other groups, TKM usage was found to have increased from 45.8% in 2008 to 69.3% in 2011. With the exception of acupuncture and physical therapy, most usage doubled or more than doubled. Conclusions: The attitudes toward and usage of TKM in South Korea have improved between 2008 and 2011. This result will be used to explain outcomes of certain social phenomena and to argue for national support in the promotion of TKM.","[Woo, Jong-Min; Park, Eun-Ji; Ahn, Miyoung; Kwon, Soohyun; Koo, Ki Hoon] Korea Inst Oriental Med, Policy Div, Taejon 305811, South Korea; [Lee, Minhee] Korea Inst Oriental Med, Herbal Med Res Div, Taejon 305811, South Korea",Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM); Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM),"Koo, KH (corresponding author), Korea Inst Oriental Med, Policy Div, 1672 Yuseongdae Ro, Taejon 305811, South Korea.",kookies@kiom.re.kr,"Woo, Jong/D-2353-2014",,Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) [K14191],Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM),The authors would like to thank Dr. Sunghwan Song and Dr. Hyeun-Kyoo Shin for designing the questionnaires and providing advice.

The study analyzes data derived from documents of the Korean and the U.S. governments, literature on Korean history, and literature on Korean education and language education. During the previous decade of Japanese colonial rule, the development of ELT had been stalled due to Japan's war against the U.S. and its allies and the colonial government's consequent suppression of Anglophone elements in the colony. With the arrival of the U.S. forces in 1945, however, the climate unfavorable to ELT reversed. The U.S. military government took various educational measures to enhance ELT. It reintroduced English as a required subject in the secondary-school curriculum and as a key subject in university entrance exams. It also established a state-run English language school and provided teacher training nationwide through the school. Despite these reform measures, however, Korean ELT maintained core characteristics set earlier during Japanese colonial rule.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, EG (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, 335 Gwahangno, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",egkim@kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Eun/C-1126-2015","Kim, Eun Gyong/0000-0002-1980-7643",,,,,43,1,6,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1568-4555,,,LANG POLICY-NETH,Lang.

As of 2020, 33,752 North Koreans had arrived in South Korea. The political positioning of North Korean refugees in South Korean society is unique from other immigrants, in that they receive immediate South Korean citizenship and are considered members of the same ethnic group as South Koreans. However, North Korean refugees face discrimination in South Korea, including in schools. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This paper extends the use of the intersectional analytical framework, disability critical race theory (DisCrit), outside of western settings to the Korean context. The purpose is to analyze the schooling experiences of North Korean refugees in South Korea. We provide a background about the divide between the nations of North and South Korea and discuss how this divide contributes to North Korean refugees' position as outsiders. We also situate discrimination faced by North Korean refugees within South Korea as a broader response to changing demographics, by highlighting the experiences of immigrants and South Korean multicultural education policy. Drawing upon the voices of North Korean refugees, we analyze how the discrimination they experience constructs them as less capable and valued than their South Korean peers. Research Design: This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study that analyzes data from semi-structured interviews of North Korean refugees in South Korea. The interviews focus on participants' schooling experiences in mainstream schools, at an alternative school, and in their transition to postsecondary education. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our analysis demonstrates how North Korean refugee students are positioned as dis/abled and come to embody disabling conditions as a result of discrimination based on their ethnicized North Korean identity in South Korea. The construction of North Korean refugees as dis/abled reflects the dominance of the ideals of South Korean ethnicity and an educational ideology that promotes assimilation for economic growth. We conclude by discussing the impact of normalizing processes of ethnocentrism, racism, and ableism, and the potential future development of multicultural education in South Korea.","[Song, Yosung] Moravian Univ, Educ Dept, Bethlehem, PA USA; [Freedman, Justin E.] Rowan Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary & Inclus Educ, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA",Rowan University,"Freedman, JE (corresponding author), Rowan Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary & Inclus Educ, Coll Educ, 201 Mullica Hill Rd, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA.",freedmanj@rowan.edu,,,Northeast Asia Council; Korea Foundation,Northeast Asia Council; Korea Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The first author received funding to support this research from the Northeast Asia Council with the support of the Korea Foundation.",,41,3,4,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

The creation of ARKO was expected to redefine the arts-state relationship in South Korea by developing arts subsidy operating at an arm's length distance from the government. However, this has not happened because Korean arts policy is so deeply embedded in the country's historical and political contexts that changes in its formal structure and organisation hardly guarantee the emergence of a new understanding and practice of state arts funding. Despite the rhetoric of the arm's length principle, the government's habitual control has persisted and even been reinforced.

In seeking a favorable environment for a South Korean-led unification, this article first analyzes China's position on Korean unification, provides evidences that China's perception of a unified Korea is reflected in its policies on the Korean Peninsula, and entertains scenarios of its future role. Specifically, this article analyzes China's perception of the Korean Peninsula's strategic value in Northeast Asia given its changing relations with the United States. Moreover, the link between China's basic position on Korean unification and its national interests, and its perception and plans on the process of the unification as well as a unified Korea will be analyzed. This paper will examine how such a perception and plans are reflected in China's policies towards both Koreas and attempt to project the future role of China in the process of unification. Finally, based on the above analysis, the paper will endeavor to conclude with some policy directives that may enhance the possibility of inducing China to become more cooperative toward Korean unification.","[Byoung-Kon, Jun; Jang-ho, Kim] Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul, South Korea",,"Jang-ho, K (corresponding author), Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul, South Korea.",jangho@kinu.or.kr,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,12,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

At its birth, the Korean YMCA's sport promotion was closely linked with the Korean nationalist movement under Japanese colonial rule, and this link was most evident around 1920, when Jang Gwon worked as a judo master. Citing the Sokol movement in Czechoslovakia, Jang Gwon took initiatives to enlighten Korean people's consciousness and popularize sports, including judo and basketball, across the country through the Korean YMCA's sport promotion. In particular, Jang Gwon introduced modern judo-formally known as Gangdogwan (Kodokan judo), initiated by Jigoro Kano-in Korea and took initiatives to establish the Korean Basketball Association and the Korean Basketball Referee Association. Through the Korean YMCA's sport promotion, Jang Gwon motivated the Korean people to aspire to liberation and independence from Japanese colonial rule. Moreover, amid the prevailing social climate, in which physical activities were discouraged due to the influence of Neo-Confucianism, he provided a paradigm shift that called for sport for all, which enabled the modernization of sports and physical education in Korea.","[Cho, Moongi] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Cho, M (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea.",ultrajo74@naver.com,,,,,,,38,2,3,0,7,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1087-1659,1543-2947,,SPORT HIST REV,Sport Hist.

The original meaning of this term implies soldiers who died or acquired a major disability as combatants; yet the DPRK media also applies this term to personnel who passed away or acquired disabilities following industrial accidents at their workplaces during military service. Initially, official media related to the theme of honorable veterans focused on issues of how veterans were re-integrating into society. In the late 1980s, the focus changed, with the main emphasis placed on civilian responses to veterans' self-sacrifice. One of the peculiar forms of such responses was the practice of proposing marriage to an unknown honorable veteran. Based on a wide variety of North Korean media materials, this article investigates this change in the official discourse about honorable veterans, considering it within the context of the changing goals of state propaganda.","[Gabroussenko, Tatiana] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Gabroussenko, T (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",t.gabroussenko@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2019-LAB-1250001],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2019-LAB-1250001) .,,49,0,0,0,1,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,,2021,52,4,,,,,603,625,,10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.4.603,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.4.603,,,23,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,YK3AN,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000745090300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the economic crisis of the 1990s, North Korea was largely dependent on the fishery industry in order to earn foreign currency. North Korea's outdated fishing boats could not travel beyond its inland sea, but were pressured to fulfill their quota of marine product catches. As a consequence, North Korea's outdated fishing boats were likely to cross the NLL in the hope of exploiting neighboring waters near the NLL. This paper demonstrates that North Korea's NLL violations rise and fall based not on South Korea's engagement or containment policy toward North Korea, but rather on North Korea's need to catch more marine products. The views expressed here are the opinions of the authors and as such do not represent the official position of the South Korean government.","[Kim, Insoo; Lee, Minyong] Korea Mil Acad, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul 139799, South Korea",,"Kim, I (corresponding author), Korea Mil Acad, Dept Polit Sci, POB 77-2 Nowon Gu Kongreung Dong, Seoul 139799, South Korea.",kma6453@gmail.com,,"KIM, INSOO/0000-0002-2599-0923",,,,,23,5,5,0,22,"MCFARLAND & COMPANY, INC, PUBLISHERS",JEFFERSON,"BOX 611, JEFFERSON, NC 28640 USA",1551-2789,1841-2886,,N KOREAN REV,North Korean Rev.,FAL,2011,7,2,,,,,57,65,,10.3172/NKR.7.2.57,http://dx.doi.org/10.3172/NKR.7.2.57,,,9,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,824DD,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000295181100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The inter-Korean qualitative arms race and US extended deterrence,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Extended deterrence; Indo-Pacific; Korean Peninsula; North Korea; South Korea; Quantitative arms race,ESCALATION; BALANCE; STATES; POWER; WAR,"PurposeThis paper aims to provide a case study of complex conflict management within the arms race on the Korean Peninsula. Exploring the complex nexus of nuclear weapons, asymmetry and a qualitative arms race, the study explains how the arms race between Seoul and Pyongyang has promoted stability on the Korean Peninsula.Design/methodology/approachPresenting the limits of arguments that the US security guarantee is the factor that saved the two Koreas from going to war again, this paper explores the utility of the inter-Korean arms race as a stabilizer that promotes indirect negotiations. While presenting Korean anomalies, this paper analyzes the three stages of the inter-Korean arms race - especially its nuclear weapons, its asymmetry and the nature of arms races - and provides extant explanations on the causes and consequences of the qualitative arms race. These key elements drive the states' strategic motives.FindingsUsing the case of the inter-Korean qualitative arms race and US extended nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula, the study shows the complexities of conflict management today. This paper identifies three contributing factors - US nuclear weapons, asymmetry and the qualitative characteristic of the arms race - to explain the enduring stability on the peninsula despite the arms race's intensification. The paper finds that although US nuclear-extended deterrence plays a critical role, it does not capture the full context of the ongoing, dynamic inter-Korean arms race; a prolonged arms race between the two Koreas has become a new regularity; the qualitative characteristic of the inter-Korean arms race, which is driven by technological advancement, contributes to stability in the arms race; and as the constant mismatch in priority technologies becomes more severe, the changes to the existing asymmetry could increase instability.Originality/valueThis paper offers a diverse perspective to the literature on conflict management and captures the complexities of 21st-century conflict management. Through a thorough examination of the inter-Korean arms race, it brings readers' attention to the nested dynamics within the arms race and shows how an intensifying arms race can promote stability. Furthermore, the paper explains the implications for potential instability - fueled by the comprehensive mix of a dynamic qualitative arms race and the US extended nuclear deterrence - in the Indo-Pacific region.","[Rim, Hyun Ji] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20001 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Rim, HJ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",hyunji.rim1@gmail.com,"Rim, Hyun Ji/JXL-8791-2024",,,,,,121,2,2,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1044-4068,1758-8545,,INT J CONFL MANAGE,Int.

Despite the popularity of accepting this 'buffering relationship' between the two countries, few scholarly works explaining this relationship in depth. What does 'China regards North Korea as a buffer state' mean? When and under what conditions did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders begin to view North Korea as a buffer state? Most importantly, how did such a buffer view shape China's behavior when North Korea's existence was endangered? The purpose of this article is to shed more lights on this unique geopolitical relationship forged in blood. It argues the CCP leaders' first view on the Korean Peninsula was nationality minority. It was the Korean War that fundamentally changed the way the leaders perceived the value of the peninsula, from a non-geopolitical to a geopolitical one-North Korea is a buffer state keeping a hostile force away from the Sino-North Korean border. Evidently, China's buffer thinking toward North Korea was one key factor contributing Chinese military and diplomatic protection over North Korea during the first North Korean nuclear crisis.","[Chen, Yu-Hua] Akita Int Univ, Akita, Japan",Akita International University,"Chen, YH (corresponding author), Akita Int Univ, Akita, Japan.",ychen@aiu.ac.jp,,"Chen, Yu-Hua/0000-0002-0475-5449",,,,,71,1,1,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1067-0564,1469-9400,,J CONTEMP CHINA,J.

It seeks to understand the impact of various political events, including South-North contacts and North Korean nuclear provocations, on South Koreans' attitudes towards unification. Methods: Using annual survey data from the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University (IPUS), this study creates a novel time-series dataset spanning from 2007 to 2021. We test how each of the inter-Korean political events affects support for unification and how key individual dispositions moderate the level of support. Results: The empirical findings reveal that inter-Korean summits and family reunions positively affect unification sentiment, with family reunions showing surprisingly stronger impacts than inter-Korean summits. Regarding North Korea's provocations, nuclear tests negatively influence public support for unification, while ballistic missile launches do not significantly impact unification sentiment, likely due to public habituation. Conclusion: This study contributes to existing literature by providing new empirical insights into the relationship between inter-Korean political events and public opinion. The findings suggest that policymakers should focus on strategic short-term initiatives, particularly increasing inter-Korean contacts, to foster long-term positive sentiment towards unification. However, it's important to note that individual variables become more influential in shaping public opinion over the long term.","[Kwon, Yewon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci BK 21, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Kyung Suk] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Incheon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Incheon National University,"Lee, KS (corresponding author), Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Incheon, South Korea.",lee.kyungsuk@inu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Kyung Suk/0000-0003-4327-7213",Incheon National University [2023-0389],Incheon National University,"Incheon National University, Grant/Award Number: 2023-0389",,46,0,0,5,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

National division led to the creation of separate religious and political organizations in the North and the South because of the increasing difficulties in communication between the two zones.

If North Korea collapses, then it would be a failed state in the sense that its government could not sustain its citizenry. Thus, it is critical that regional powers discuss the possible outcomes of the North Korean stalemate and its impact on Northeast Asian regional security. The Republic of Korea (ROK) government, especially, should prepare for the possible outcomes of a North Korean catastrophe based on discussions, dialogues, and consultations with influential regional actors, such as the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC). Given this context, this article aims to focus on the DPRK's deteriorating situations, analyze surrounding states' policy positions, and provide some meaningful policy considerations that the ROK government might consider in terms of political, security, and legal aspects of the North Korean contingency. It concludes that regarding any future emergency situation within the DPRK, regional cooperation and policy coordination among concerned governments are of the utmost importance. Given the urgency any rapid changes within the North might produce in the region, the international community and regional powers are expected to keep an acute eye on what will unfold on North Korean affairs in the foreseeable future.","[Cho, Jung-hyun; Han, Dong-ho] Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul 142728, South Korea; [Lee, Ji-yong] MOFAT, Inst Foreign Affairs & Natl Secur, Seoul 137863, South Korea",,"Cho, JH (corresponding author), Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul 142728, South Korea.",jhcho521@kinu.or.kr; gud109@hotmail.com; jylee10@mofat.go.kr,"Lee, Ji-Yong/ITU-6980-2023",,,,,,17,2,2,0,10,"MCFARLAND & COMPANY, INC, PUBLISHERS",JEFFERSON,"BOX 611, JEFFERSON, NC 28640 USA",1551-2789,1841-2886,,N KOREAN REV,North Korean Rev.,SPR,2012,8,1,,,,,37,52,,10.3172/NKR.8.1.37,http://dx.doi.org/10.3172/NKR.8.1.37,,,16,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,910BP,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000301612500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the emergence of the post-Cold War era led to their redefinition as defected ethnic North Koreans, North Korean refugees, defected North Korean residents, and recently North Korean migrants. These new names clearly indicate the historical changes in discourse surrounding North Korean migration and their social and cultural positions in South Korea. By tracing these discursive shifts alongside social policy toward North Korean migration, this paper aims to investigate the processes in which arrivals have been ideologically and socially located in the post-Cold War South, where, nevertheless, ideological legacies remain powerful.","Sungkonghoe Univ, Inst E Asia Studies, Seoul, South Korea",,"Kim, SK (corresponding author), Sungkonghoe Univ, Inst E Asia Studies, 151-716,1-1 Hang Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",bible0729@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,12,22,2,47,"MCFARLAND & COMPANY, INC, PUBLISHERS",JEFFERSON,"BOX 611, JEFFERSON, NC 28640 USA",1551-2789,1841-2886,,N KOREAN REV,North Korean Rev.,FAL,2012,8,2,,,,,94,110,,10.3172/NKR.8.2.94,http://dx.doi.org/10.3172/NKR.8.2.94,,,17,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,998UL,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000308265800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This decision was heavily criticized by the biggest opposition party, the Leftist Mapam. Through Al Ha-mishmar - the party's mouthpiece newspaper - Mapam displayed a high level of interest in North Korea and the war. Based on a critical reading of the newspaper, this article investigates how the party framed the conflict, and contributes to the fields of both Israel studies and Korean studies. I argue that perceptions of North Korea played a noticeable role in shaping early-Mapam's ideological identity. Al Ha-mishmar put North Korea on a pedestal using the devices of emotive rhetoric and juxtaposition, and, although it reiterated international communist narratives, it contextualized them within the party's agenda in the local context. The conflict was evidence that Israel was wrong to side with the US imperialists, and the North Korean fight inspired an expression of cross-Asian solidarity. This fitted Mapam's aspiration of Israel joining the global anti-colonial camp. The North's struggle was in line with Mapam's admiration of the USSR and Stalin; concomitantly, framing the struggle further consolidated this attitude.","[Podoler, Guy] Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Podoler, G (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, Haifa, Israel.",gpodoler@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,92,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0707-5332,1949-6540,,INT HIST REV,Int.

This study aimed to investigate the current use and determinants associated with KM among children and adolescents through an analysis of the 2019 Korea Health Panel Annual Data. Subjects were divided into two groups: the integrative medicine (IM) group, utilizing both KM and conventional medicine (CM) (n = 163), and the CM-only group (n = 1843) for the year 2019. Differences in various factors between the IM and CM groups were investigated using the chi-square test or t-tests. Moreover, binomial logistic regression was employed to ascertain factors influencing the choice of KM over exclusive CM utilization. The IM group had a higher mean age (p = 0.011) and annual household income (p < 0.001) compared to the CM group. The regression analysis indicated a significant association between the use of both KM and CM and being an adolescent (p = 0.011), residing in Seoul/Gyeonggi/Incheon (p = 0.017), living in Daejeon/Chungcheong/Sejong (p = 0.001), and belonging to the first income percentile (p = 0.002). Significant differences were observed in the KM usage patterns between the groups of children and adolescents. These insights could contribute to the development of strategies for the optimal allocation of medical resources within South Korea's distinctive medical framework.","[Kwon, Chan-Young] Dong Eui Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Oriental Neuropsychiat, 52-57 Yangjeong Ro, Busan 47227, South Korea",Dong-Eui University,"Kwon, CY (corresponding author), Dong Eui Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Oriental Neuropsychiat, 52-57 Yangjeong Ro, Busan 47227, South Korea.",beanalogue@deu.ac.kr,"Kwon, Chan-Young/ABI-2048-2022","Kwon, Chan-Young/0000-0003-0068-9904",,,,,33,2,2,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9032,,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,FEB,2024,12,4,,,,,,,467,10.3390/healthcare12040467,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare12040467,,,11,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,JR9U8,38391842,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:001175018500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This analysis demonstrates that North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016 changed the dynamic of the project. Before the test, when inter-Korean relations were good, South Korea and Russia could make efforts to secure political support for the project. However, after the fourth nuclear test, this was no longer the case. As North Korea's nuclear power status became more evident, this nuclear problem began to have profound implications for U.S. security. In response, Washington not only led the UN Security Council to impose very severe sanctions against North Korea, but also placed its own sanctions on the country. These sanctions began to contain provisions that could prevent the implementation of the pipeline project. In addition to these sanctions, the U.S. sanctions against Russia in 2017 over its intervention in the U.S. election and aggression against Ukraine also contained clauses that could hamper it. Therefore, unless the U.S. lifts or eases all of these sanctions, South Korea and Russia are unwilling to take any concrete actions to secure political support for the RNS pipeline project. Based on this analysis, this paper argues that the U.S. now holds the most important key to its political viability.","[Lee, Yusin] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 280 Daehakro, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Lee, Y (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 280 Daehakro, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",yslee71@gmail.com,"Lee, Yusin/AAR-3857-2021","Lee, Yusin/0000-0002-8144-2892",Yeungnam University [218A380143],Yeungnam University,This research has been supported by the 2018 Yeungnam University research grant (218A380143).,,55,1,1,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY 2,2019,12,10,,,,,,,1895,10.3390/en12101895,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12101895,,,17,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,IC5OE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000471016700074,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the one hand, it rejects and resists this process and on the other hand, it appropriates the global sports stage to pursue a complex political agenda. This paper focuses on the Arirang Festival that usually takes place in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and challenges and repudiates the prominence of commodified and globally controlled mega sports events. At the same time, this event offers North Korea a global forum to demonstrate the uniqueness and success of its political system and to foster an alternative discourse about the country.

Intriguingly, most topics contained several new articles related to government policies. Considering the characteristics of the mobile network industry-e.g. as an industry that receives licenses from the government-this result suggests that 5G-related issues are closely related to government policies. Our topic modeling results confirm that the interventionist promotion policy of the Korean government which acted as a catalyst for technology and business innovation played an important role in Korea's 5G leadership.","[Kim, Min Sung; Kim, Seongcheol] Korea Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Junghwan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Media Sch, Busan, South Korea",Korea University; Pukyong National University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",hiddentrees@korea.ac.kr,,"Kim, Seongcheol/0000-0001-6703-4465","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A3A2099973]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) , Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2023-2020-0-01749]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) , Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea, the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A3A2099973) , and by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) , Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2023-2020-0-01749) supervised by the IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation) .",,51,3,4,4,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

How might this seemingly pessimistic message, read widely by Korean Catholics during the nineteenth century, support conversion in spite of the burden it imposes? This article explores the theme of soul judgment in Direct Exposition against the background of preexisting Korean cultural paradigms. It shows that this teaching carried a logic that could be compelling to Choson Catholics, and that the psychological burdens such threats of judgment in the afterlife might impose could be mitigated by promises of help featured in the same text. This analysis also concludes that, in the political and social situation of nineteenth-century Korea, the emphasis on soul judgment offered validation of suffering and control over destiny.","[Torrey, Deberniere Janet] Univ Utah, Dept World Languages & Cultures, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Torrey, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept World Languages & Cultures, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,,Academy of Korean Studies; North East Asia Council of the Association for Asian Studies; University of Utah University Research Committee and College of Humanities,Academy of Korean Studies; North East Asia Council of the Association for Asian Studies; University of Utah University Research Committee and College of Humanities,"I wish to thank the Academy of Korean Studies for a Korean studies grant that allowed me time to focus on this project.

Through an in-depth examination of the South Korean youth and student movement and young people's changing attitudes to North Korea and unification, I suggest that a change in the nature of nationalism has occurred - a shift from a nationalism based on a peninsula-wide concept of nation, to the emergence of a South Korean nationalism. This has important consequences for policy-makers trying to understand events in South Korea, the Korean peninsula, and wider Northeast Asian region.

Global and Korea-specific uncertainty are measured using the method proposed by Mumtaz and Theodoridis (2017). A rise in both the uncertainty measures has an adverse impact on the Korean economy by lowering stock market returns and output growth, and by creating inflation caused by currency depreciation. Quantitatively, the domestic uncertainty shock exercises a larger effect on the Korean economy than the global uncertainty shock, as the former uncertainty shock accounts for about one-fifth of output variation and the latter accounts for about one-tenth. Regarding time-varying effects, substantial increases in domestic uncertainty during the Asian Financial Crisis and global uncertainty during the Global Financial Crisis explain a significant part of macroeconomic fluctuations in Korea during those periods. This is because of the increased volatility of uncertainty shocks during these periods, rather than a structural change in the way these shocks affect the economy.","[Hwang, So Jung; Suh, Hyunduk] Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Incheon, South Korea",Inha University,"Suh, H (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Incheon, South Korea.",hsuh@inha.ac.kr,"; hwang, sojung/MBH-7972-2025; Suh, Hyunduk/KIV-9180-2024","Suh, Hyunduk/0000-0003-1761-6592; hwang, sojung/0000-0003-1340-1658;",Inha University Research Grant,Inha University Research Grant,This work is supported by Inha University Research Grant.,,20,3,3,1,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1049-0078,1873-7927,,J ASIAN ECON,J.

We join the debate by studying how the success of Korean cultural products in Taiwan has improved the relationship between South Korea and Taiwan. The two countries normalized their relationship in 1948 and maintained cooperation until the severance of formal ties in 1992 because of South Korea's rapprochement with China. Beginning in early 2000, however, South Korea's cultural products have enjoyed great success in Taiwan. Since that time, the relationship between the two countries has significantly improved, including trade and tourism expansion, increased Taiwanese direct investment in South Korea, and policy changes by Taiwan's government. These changes provide empirical evidence of soft power.","[Hahm, Sung Deuk] Korea Inst Presidential Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Hahm, Sung Deuk] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Hahm, Sung Deuk] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Song, Sooho] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Foreign Languages & Literature, Milwaukee, WI USA",Korea University; Georgetown University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Hahm, SD (corresponding author), Korea Inst Presidential Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",hahm33@hotmail.com; sooho@uwm.edu,,,,,,,62,6,6,2,32,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",0004-4687,1533-838X,,ASIAN SURV,Asian Surv.,MAR-APR,2021,61,2,,,,,217,240,,10.1525/AS.2021.61.2.217,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/AS.2021.61.2.217,,,24,Area Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies,SP1WF,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000659463300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One important goal of the North Korean regime is to create ties with Koreans living outside the country through its official website. Analyzing media representation of a transborder Korean nation, this article discusses the shifts that have occurred in the recent context of the peace process on the Korean peninsula. I argue that the transborder nation-building in North Korean official media reveals a hybrid form of patriotism and nationalism that juxtaposes loyalty to the nation and loyalty to the state. North Korean media thus emerges as a critical site where the two loyalties coexist, demonstrating an attempt to provide the impression of a whole-albeit divided and dispersed-Korean nation.","[Choi, Sunkyung] Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea",,"Choi, S (corresponding author), Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",walkwith@kyungnam.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government [NRF-2017S1A3A2065782],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government(National Research Foundation of Korea),Gratitude to Professor Woo Young Lee and Professor Sung Kyung Kim for their support.

The group is identified as alternately exemplifying and challenging neoliberal logic and the article considers the relationship between neoliberalism and different forms of cosmopolitanism.

In particular, for South Korea, although its past and present are deeply entwined with North Korea, physical access to the country is strictly denied. This study focuses on how contemporary South Korean artists have constructed North Korea as a liminal space in which reality and fiction, past and present collide. It analyzes contemporary artworks that attempt to de-border the other Korea. These works include Kwon Hayoun's Model Village (2014), a video centered on a reconstruction of an uninhabited North Korean propaganda village on the edge of the DMZ, and Park Chan-kyong's Sets (2000), a series of slides of a North Korean film studio that recreated the streets of Seoul and a South Korean movie set that included a replica of P'anmunjom. Based on the unique relationship between the two Koreas, the paper argues that contemporary South Korean art embodies the elusive reality of North Korea that defies the clear understanding of its truth. In addition, it shows that the ambiguous representation of North Korea is a compelling reminder of the long history of national division and the psychological and physical distance between the two Koreas. This de-bordering expands the epistemological frame through which to perceive Korea beyond that of a binary Cold War order framework.","[Chang, Boyoung] Vanderbilt Univ, Hist Art & Architecture, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Chang, BY (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Hist Art & Architecture, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",bychang08@gmail.com,,,The 2021 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2021-R-041],The 2021 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies,"This research was supported by the 2021 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2021-R-041) .

This represents a sort of middle ground' between formerly hegemonic state centric' approaches to global processes (focusing heavily on the international') and more recent ones emphasizing transnational' dynamics (which primarily arise through the agency of cross-border migrants). We discuss a typology of approaches and avoid the tendency to set nation-states against global and transnational processes. In fact, we highlight the various ways in which states often initiate key transnational flows, such as migration and the integration of diasporic communities into the sending nation, as well as maintain and regulate various processes instigated by immigrants. As an iconic case, we present an illustrative study of the South Korean government and Korean diasporic communities in the USA.

Furthermore, as the two countries from both ends of the continent cooperated in various areas during the 1960s and 1970s, relations were becoming more complicated and even officially rather cool in light of Korea's evolving relations with the Arab world. Against this backdrop, and based on the reading of contemporaneous Israeli press, the study argues that culture mattered very much in the early stages of the relations. Cultural contacts between Koreans and Israelis started well before the establishment of full diplomatic relations, and cultural diplomacy played a significant role in maintaining them in the decades that followed. Like today, both parties often emphasized the cultural and historical affinities between the two peoples, and in the process, the Israeli public was exposed to early glimpses into Korean culture while images of Korea and its people were created as well.","Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Podoler, G (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",gpodoler@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,69,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

What capabilities does China deploy to the NTC? How does it compare to the other theater commands? And do NTC's military capabilities change the existing balance of power on the Korean Peninsula? Using the most up-to-date data, this paper offers, first, a theater -level comparative analysis of the PLA and, second, a quantitative assessment of how China's NTC capabilities affect the military balance of power between North Korea on the one hand, and South Korea and the U.S. Forces Korea on the other. Of PLA's five theater commands, the paper finds that the NTC has maintained the largest and heaviest ground force, the largest air force, and the second most powerful naval fleet. When NTC military capabilities are added to the existing military balance between North Korean forces and the U.S.- South Korean alliance forces, the United States and South Korea's air supremacy is challenged and naval dominance is overturned.

By focusing on leadership, regime, and social factors in the two Koreas, the article emphasizes the social dynamics that are shaping inter-Korean relations despite the nuclear dispute. In the political realm, a tough stance toward North Korea's nuclear ambition by the South's government has created a sense of frustration within the North Korean leadership, causing tension and conflict with the South. In the social realm, however, both Koreas have been pressured by political and economic hardship and a growing sense of crisis among their citizens. From that latter perspective, however, the prospects are that the two Koreas will move toward more cooperative behavior.

This article focuses on the reactions of politicians, ranging from the radical leftwing to a weakened rightwing, and deals mainly with an analysis of the French communist press, the campaign to ban the atomic bomb, the Communist-led protests against the alleged germ warfare of the United States in Korea and General Ridgway coming to France, and last but not least, opinion polls conducted in 1950 concerning the War in Korea, the role of the UN, the Cold War and the risks of a Third World War. The latter was a prominent concern at the time, and was easily exploited by communist propaganda.

J,"Yoo, KS",,,,"Yoo, Kwang Suk",,,The Growth of Korea Soka Gakkai International (KSGI) and Its Civic Engagement in the Socio-Historical Context,RELIGIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Korea Soka Gakkai international; Korean Buddhist lay movement; faith-based civic engagement; Korean new religious movements; Korean religious market,RELIGION,"This paper examines how and why Korea Soka Gakkai International (KSGI) has grown rapidly in the Korean religious market. Although Soka Gakkai was introduced to Korea as a Nichiren Shoshu lay community in the 1960s, KSGI has achieved remarkable growth without the structurally covert and organizationally authoritative control typical of traditional elite Buddhism. This fact is significant in both theory and practice, as lay movements have historically not been very successful in Korean religions. Focusing on the paradoxical affinity between secular civic movements and religious lay movements, this paper explains why and how KSGI had to combine the two movements in a socio-historical context different from that of its Japanese partner, which established a public political party, the Komeito, and formed a coalition government with other parties. As a result, this paper reveals the following findings: first, KSGI's nonpolitical civic engagement led to a more effective growth strategy tailored to the Korean socio-historical context. Second, the Korean government's policy of opening up to Japanese culture since the 2000s played a significant role in the growth of KSGI. Third, the spread of civil movements in Korea contributed to enhancing KSGI's social adaptability and credibility.","[Yoo, Kwang Suk] Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Relig & Civ Culture, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, KS (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Relig & Civ Culture, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",ksyooii@khu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088321]; National Research Foundation of Korea,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088321].,,47,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,FEB,2025,16,2,,,,,,,133,10.3390/rel16020133,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel16020133,,,12,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,Y2T7Z,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001430720100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The alliance exists to this day, and there are still many who can scarcely imagine a Korean peninsula without U.S. military forces present. The curious triangle of Korean-U.S.-Japanese relations, however, began much earlier. A forced treaty with Japan in 1876 was the first attempt to coerce Korea away from the traditional East Asian world order, while a treaty of amity and commerce with America in 1882 represented a more autonomous move toward a new global configuration. With annexation in 1910, the first battle lines had been drawn: Japan had betrayed Korea and America represented the best hope for salvation. And this was more than historical reality; it also clearly manifest itself in works of early modern Korean fiction, which reveal a naive optimism regarding America's role in Korea's modernization and rescue. With the failure of America, however, to come to Korea's aid during the independence movement of March 1, 1919, there came a turning away from the U.S. and to Japan. The U.S., once the promised land, became a wasteland, while Japan came to fill the vacated position of redeemer. From the 1920s, we see a systematic dismantling of America's privileged position and a concomitant acceptance of the reality of Japanese hegemony. Ironically, however, Japanese oppression and American silence liberated Koreans psychologically from the naive fantasy of U.S. salvation, even as they politically drove them further toward subjugation and assimilation.","Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Frankl, JM (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jmfrankl@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,0,1,0,4,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,DEC,2014,17,2,,,SI,,639,671,,,,,,33,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,AW6HR,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000346370900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the post-Cold-War era, the security environment of the Korean Peninsula and the importance of the United States for South Korea's security are no different from that during the Cold War. However, unlike the past, South Korea has not complied with US leadership during the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations, but has adopted policy opposed to that of the United States. This study started with the question of what variables explain South Korean policy toward North Korea in the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations and why South Korea has not followed the US leadership since the Kim Dae-jung presidency, unlike in the past. In order to answer the above puzzle, this study tries to analyze the puzzling situation with the feature of constructivism, such as the change of national identity. From this study, I found that generational change in South Korea from the Korean War generation to the 386 and Internet generations played an important role in the change of South Korean national identity.

North Korea failed to grasp a historically unprecedented three-year window of two overlapping dovish presidents governing its primary geopolitical opponents. Trump and Moon both aggressively sought a major inter-Korean breakthrough; they represented a unique opportunity in the long Korean stand-off for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to press his peninsular claims. Yet Pyongyang offered no serious concessions in the 2018-2020 window, and the politico-military situation on the ground in Korea is essentially unchanged today. We argue that this failure will, at minimum, encourage the reemergence of establishmentarian, status quo policies under the new American administration of President Joseph Biden. Further, North Korea's recalcitrance in this unique dovish period will likely push the Overton Window of acceptable counter-North Korea policy options rightward. Harsher measures will be considered in the wake of engagement's failure.","[Presidencies, Moon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Busan, South Korea; [Derr, Arius M.] Australian Natl Univ, Coral Bell Sch Asia Pacific Affairs, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Pusan National University; Australian National University,"Derr, AM (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Coral Bell Sch Asia Pacific Affairs, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",robertkelly260@hotmail.com,,,,,,,69,2,2,2,9,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Many South Korean painters from this period turned to the idea of materiality, the amplification or replication of soil, rice, and earthenware on painted surfaces, as a means to create a visual culture that was bound to a unique Koreanness while simultaneously emerging as universal and timeless. The article focuses on the work of one artist in particular, arguably South Korea's best known from this period, the painter Kim Whanki. Through an examination of Kim's oeuvre, I argue that he sought to develop a method of painting that allowed him to fuse the painterly practice of Western modernism with the process and surface of Korean earthenware to create a new visual language that disengaged from simple dualisms between East and West. Instead, Kim sought to envision a mode of painting that allowed both artwork and artist to embody the ambiguity of somewhere in between.","[Hahn, Christine Y.] Kalamazoo Coll, Hist, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA",Kalamazoo College,"Hahn, CY (corresponding author), Kalamazoo Coll, Hist, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,1,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",1067-9847,1527-8271,,POSITIONS-ASIA CRIT,Positions-Asia Crit.,MAY,2016,24,2,,,,,481,+,,10.1215/10679847-3458697,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/10679847-3458697,,,33,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,DZ1GK,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000385586700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, problems arise because these mutually amicable paths of trade and health policies are occasionally thrown into disarray, as demonstrated by the recent beef struggles in Korea. This struggle demonstrates how badly a legitimate trade liberalization effort can be thrown into disarray if there is a lack of a consensus-building process in domestic politics. It also shows how deeply domestic politics may penetrate trade policies in situations in which there is an imbalance of power among interest groups. Serious and continuous procedural steps must be taken through active communication with the general public so that unnecessary political struggles induced by misinformation and consumer anxiety can he minimized. Without building consumer confidence in domestic politics, any international standards or scientific principles may only build a house of cards. To shape integrated trade and health policies in highly political environments, governments need to maintain a high-level health and food safety management system. Such a system, based on an overall balance of interest between domestic producers and consumers, should help stabilize their long-term trade relationship with the world.","Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Choi, WM (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea.",wmchoi91@hanmail.net,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,12,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

However, looking at the bigger picture, it is unmistakable that research agendas are growing increasingly closer.

In particular, this article focuses on the changing relationship of pro-North Korea, Zainichi Koreans (Koreans in Japan) towards North Korea. Many Koreans in Japan continue to identify with North Korea, but the nature of this relationship has changed, due to shifting generational attitudes towards both the host society and North Korea. A dance recital I witnessed in an ethnic Korean high school in Japan exemplifies these changes. I suggest that the symbols highlighted within the recital articulate a particular form of political-ethnic identity that is characterised by a long distance nationalism, but without the desire to return to the homeland. Based on a year of ethnographic fieldwork with members of the pro-North Korea organisation, Ch'ongryon, this paper explores how diasporic groups construct, negotiate, and reproduce identity in relation to nation states and transnational processes.","[Bell, Markus] Univ Sheffield, Sch East Asian Studies, Off A-02,6-8 Shearwood Rd, Sheffield S10 2TD, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Bell, M (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch East Asian Studies, Off A-02,6-8 Shearwood Rd, Sheffield S10 2TD, S Yorkshire, England.",Markus.Bell@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Bell, Markus/0000-0003-2364-3730",,,,,54,7,7,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1444-2213,1740-9314,,ASIA PAC J ANTHROPOL,Asia Pac.

Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to assess daily vegetable intake and consumption ratio of vegetables for different meal types/dining locations. Analysis was stratified by sex and age group. Daily vegetable intake increased from 293.5g in 1998 to 305.7g in 2001 and to 335.9g in 2005. Findings were similar in men and women, as well as in each age group. Analyses for each meal type revealed that vegetable intake during breakfast did not substantially change, but vegetable intake increased during lunch and dinner. While vegetable consumption ratio during breakfast decreased, it increased during lunch and snack time. Men and women showed similar change in the analysis for meal types and dining locations. There were some differences between the age groups in daily vegetable intake depending on the meal type. Another notable observation was the increasing change of vegetable intake during lunch and during meals eaten at cafeterias and restaurants in all the age groups. Analysis of vegetable consumption ratio showed an increased consumption in cafeterias, restaurants, and other places and decreased vegetable intake at home for those aged 16-64 years with time. Since this change may be related to improvements in socioeconomic status, it will be necessary to further investigate difference in vegetable intake based on socioeconomic levels within the population.","[Lee, Jung-Sug; Kim, Jeongseon] Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Canc Epidemiol Branch, Goyang Si 410769, Gyeoggi Do, South Korea",National Cancer Center - Korea (NCC),"Kim, J (corresponding author), Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Canc Epidemiol Branch, 111 Jungbalsan Ro,Madu 1 Dong, Goyang Si 410769, Gyeoggi Do, South Korea.",jskim@ncc.re.kr,"; KIM, JEONGSEON/AAA-4643-2022","Lee, Jung-sug/0000-0001-8738-6409;","National Cancer Center [0731060-1, 0910221-1]",National Cancer Center,The present study was supported by the National Cancer Center (0731060-1 and 0910221-1).,,28,18,18,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-1145,1475-2662,,BRIT J NUTR,Br.

We document empirical evidence showing that cross-sectional stock return tends to react positively to positive geopolitical events under the current regime in North Korea (Kim Jong-un), whereas negative geopolitical events have limited impact. Conversely, we find that negative geopolitical events yielded more pronounced effects on the stock returns of related firms under the former regime (Kim Jong-il). In addition, this study investigates the role of geopolitical shock in the evolution of aggregate economic variables of South Korea using Caldara and Iacoviello's (2018) geopolitical risk index. Geopolitical shock is found to yield no statistically meaningful impact on stock price index, industrial output, employment, or gross trade volume. Furthermore, aggregate stock market variables are found to be immune to geopolitical shock in South Korea. These results indicate that market participants estimate the escalation of geopolitical risk into full-scale war as unlikely.","[Pyo, Dong-Jin] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Chang Won, South Korea",Changwon National University,"Pyo, DJ (corresponding author), 20 Chanwondaehek Ro, Chang Won 51140, Gyeongnam, South Korea.",djpyo@changwon.ac.kr,,,Changwon National University,Changwon National University,This research was supported by Changwon National University in 2019 ~ 2020.,,29,15,15,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Based on our review on the history of Korean archery, two additional key elements in terms of organization and administration were also included to form the analytical framework of this research, aside from Green and Houlihan's four key policy elements. Our analytical framework is thus comprised of two background elements for elite sport development - the organizational structure and administration, and four areas of elite sport policy. According to our analytical framework, this paper highlights four key policy dimensions that have influenced South Korea's archery success, as follows: (i) establishment of the Korean Archery Association (KAA) and the involvement of business elites; (ii) emergence of potential full-time archers by the identification of, and the support for, young talented athletes; (iii) developments in sport science, coaching, and facilities/equipment; and (iv) the provision of more systematic competition opportunities for elite-level archers. In summary, the success of Korean archers might be closely linked to the result of the KAA's staunch strategy and policy initiatives encouraged by the government for international sporting success and the way in which the organization has paid more salient attention to the policy commitments as noted above.","[Park, Jae-Woo] Hanyang Univ, Div Sports & Well Being, Ansan, South Korea; [Tan, Tien-Chin] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Sport Leisure & Hospitality Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Park, Hyun-Uk] Baekseok Culture Univ, Div Sports & Leisure, Cheonan, South Korea",Hanyang University; National Taiwan Normal University,"Tan, TC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Sport Leisure & Hospitality Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",tangtony60@ntnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,39,5,6,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-3367,1743-9035,,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

The controversy occurred in the wake of a series of conflicts in the late twentieth century over the legitimate placement of healing practices, medicinal substances, and medical technologies within Korea's separate Western Medicine (WM) and Korean Medicine (KM) systems of health care and pharmaceutical distribution. The controversy concerned an attempt to use hi-tech imaging technology-the epitome of modern medicine-in a clinic that maintains a strong ideological attachment to Korean healing traditions. A close study of this dispute, based on interviews, participant observation, and documentary analysis, showed that discursive positions taken about the translatability of medical technologies changed with the context of dispute, and did not reflect a stable epistemic boundary between rival medical paradigms.","[Ma, Eunjeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Creat IT Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Lynch, Michael] Cornell Univ, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Cornell University,"Lynch, M (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, 302 Rockefeller Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mel27@cornell.edu,"Ma, Eunjeong/U-8113-2017","Ma, Eunjeong/0000-0002-6609-4826",,,,,50,8,9,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0162-2439,1552-8251,,SCI TECHNOL HUM VAL,Sci.

While the Byungjin Line pays more attention to the civilian economy unlike the North's preceding policies, it has made only marginal progress short of innovation in its economy but strengthened the national defense industry reinforcing its conventional warfare capacity as well as nuclear arsenal. Without making any dramatic changes, the Byungjin Line is unsustainable in the long term, deepening international sanctions and prolonging the country's economic isolation. South Korea should follow policies encouraging North Korea prioritize economy in its own policy, reducing the North's economic dependence on China, and adopt a pragmatic approach to the North's nuclear ambitions.","[Han, Tak Sung] Korea Inst Def Analyses, Seoul, South Korea; [Joo, Jeon Kyung] Korea Inst Def Analyses, North Korea Mil Studies Div, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea",,"Han, TS (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Analyses, Seoul, South Korea.",shtak@kida.re.kr; jeonk@kida.re.kr,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,9,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

By analyzing Ultimate Oppa (2022), I align with a decolonial impulse to study a regional Asian co-production that excludes the usual analysis of the dominant European-U.S. film axis. I argue that intra-Asian co-productions produce ideological asymmetries in these arrangements. In Ultimate Oppa, the relationship between the Philippines and Korea is set against the macro-level influences of unequal soft power between Korean and Philippine media, producing visible dialectical tensions. As such, this essay argues that Ultimate Oppa ambivalently presents a cross-national romantic fantasy that reifies regional hierarchies, which are made more palatable through ideological dialectics.","[Oh, David C.] Syracuse Univ, Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, Dept Commun, 215 Univ Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Oh, DC (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, Dept Commun, 215 Univ Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",dcoh@syr.edu,"Oh, David/KFS-7832-2024",,,,I would like to express my gratitude to Jonathan Ong for reading and providing feedback on an early draft of this essay.,,45,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1529-5036,1479-5809,,CRIT STUD MEDIA COMM,Crit.

Drawing from the concept of postmemory, I examine how their northern heritage is experienced, constructed, mediated, and even solidified across generations who did not directly experience the Korean War. Unlike existing literature that predominantly focuses on the traumatic aspects of postmemory, I found that one's construction of postmemory also encompasses positive family memories. These affirming memories exist alongside traumatic ones, countering the overdetermined paradigm of trauma across memory studies. Thus, I propose alternative ways of remembering that capture a nuanced understanding of how the second and third generations construct positive postmemories alongside the traumatic memories of their ancestors.","[Jeon, Ahrum] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Jeon, Ahrum] Boston Coll, Curriculum & Instruct, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College; Boston College,"Jeon, A (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Curriculum & Instruct, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",ahrum.jeon@bc.edu,,,,,,,50,0,0,3,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1750-6980,1750-6999,,MEM STUD,Mem.

Loosely communicated through Islam, the community develops its own identity and culture, diversifies ethnically, and remains isolated from the larger Korean society.

One is the interstitial identity, meaning that they participate neither in the politics of the majority Korean society nor that of the origin country. The other is a reconstituted identity that aspires for integration into mainstream Korean society by actively participating while preserving their distinctiveness. The current Korean government's multicultural policy may drive Muslims in Korea to take the first path. The current development of the Muslim community in Korea, however, may demand that the Korean government and people employ more inclusive multiculturalism policies to facilitate Muslims in Korea to take the second path.

This essay draws on jus in bello analogies to analyze UN sanctions via standard ethical criteria of effectiveness, necessity and proportionality. It shows that UN sanctions did not fulfill the effectiveness criterion as they were never likely to result in the denuclearization of North Korea. The necessity condition was strained as the alternative instrument of diplomacy was not utilized in a sustained manner. Expanded sanctions from 2016 did not distinguish between the military and civilian economies. Stringent energy sanctions introduced in 2017 contributed significantly to a precipitous fall in agricultural production in 2018 such that the country could no longer feed about a third of the 25 million population.

In the 1920s and 1930s the term was used to describe a multifaceted phenomenon that was driven by a striving for upward social mobility and the idea of national self-strengthening. Based on a wide range of sources including newspapers and journals, official documents as well as missionary reports, the article argues that 'education fever' was, on the one hand, closely linked to Korean nationalism, whose proponents made frequent recourse to the ubiquitous phenomenon in order to strengthen Korean political power through education. On the other hand, despite efforts to restrict school access, colonial authorities to a certain degree were forced to respond to these demands for education, highlighting Korean agency in the process.","[Neuhaus, Dolf-Alexander] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Japanese Studies, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Neuhaus, DA (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Japanese Studies, Berlin, Germany.",Dolf.Neuhaus@fu-berlin.de,"; Neuhaus, Dolf-Alexander/CAF-6395-2022","Neuhaus, Dolf-Alexander/0000-0003-3877-1794;",,,,,84,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-760X,1464-5130,,HIST EDUC,Hist.

By reviewing recent developments in Chinese diplomacy towards the peninsula, this article highlights both the achievements and contradictions inherent in Beijing's two-Korea policy. North Korea has risked China's wrath by pursuing a nuclear deterrent, and by refusing to enact market reforms. In the case of the South, the government of Lee Myung-bak has strengthened its alliance with the United States and also sought to compensate for its growing economic interdependence with China by seeking free trade agreements with other states, including the US.

In parallel with the promotion of Korean-Japanese intermarriage by the Japanese colonial government, a number of films produced during the colonial period portrayed intimate Korean-Japanese relationships, including marriages, friendships and affective communities. These representations disappeared immediately after the liberation, but they reappeared in the 1960s in South Korean cinema, owing to a shift in the government's attitude toward Japan. Among Korean movies shot in Japan or featuring Japanese culture, colonial intimacy was a popular topic, particularly when it depicted romance between Korean men and Japanese women against the background of colonial history. This article argues that manifestations of colonial intimacy in Korean cinema between the 1940s and the 1960s - the transwar period - had a clear affinity with one another, portraying diverse emotions and affective relationships even in films featuring a propagandistic or nationalist militarised masculinity. I also highlight the inconsistencies of this period: whereas pre-1945 movies focussed on mutual support within affective communities, 1960s works more strongly foregrounded male heroes. All of these representations, however, critically reflect on the sociopolitical conditions of colonialism, the civil war and the Cold War.","[Kim, Su Yun] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Kim, SY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",suyunkim@hku.hk,"Kim, Su/H-4458-2012","Kim, Su Yun/0000-0002-9976-7441",Research Grant Council of Hong Kong,Research Grant Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),This work was supported by the General Research Fund and Early Career Scheme of the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong.,,50,3,3,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Such a gender gap contradicts the findings of studies on refugee attitudes in Western countries. This article proposes two distinct explanations for the gap: 1. intra-gender competition induced by a gendered labour market and gender-imbalanced defector inflows and 2. gendered outgroup attitudes where women show greater anxiety and aversion towards an unfamiliar outgroup than do men. The explanations are tested using annually repeated cross-sectional survey data (2007-18). I find more consistent support for the gendered outgroup attitude explanation. Whilst South Koreans of both genders increasingly see the two Koreas as socio-culturally distinct, such perceptions of otherness are more strongly linked to negative defector attitudes among South Korean women. I also provide first-cut evidence that knowledge of North Korean society and politics mitigates the outgroup anxiety and, in turn, can mitigate the gender gap in defector attitudes. These findings hold implications for defector and refugee policies in South Korea and other refugee host countries in the region.","[Lim, Sijeong] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 12841, South Korea",Korea University,"Lim, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 12841, South Korea.",sijeonglim@korea.ac.kr,"; Lim, Sijeong/JXO-3670-2024","Lim, Sijeong/0000-0003-4792-2216;",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5A8040915],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5A8040915).,,76,0,0,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0951-6328,1471-6925,,J REFUG STUD,J.

Its place in world literary studies, however, has often been obscured by the author's later collaboration with the colonial state. This article attempts a new, spatialized reading of the much-studied work to reconsider alterity (Japan-Korea, city-hometown) as a precondition of modernity itself. The ancient seat of the Choson dynasty (1392-1910), Seoul in the 1910s was swiftly transforming into the minjok national capital and, simultaneously, a colonial city-within-empire. Competing identities of nation-versus-empire dominated its surfaces, veiling the processes of coming up (sanggyong ??) to the capital from forgotten localities, as many writers associated with Seoul were actually from provinces with regional affinities. The Heartlessa paean to the enlightenment and to the Korean minjoksurprisingly reflects this dynamic, testifying to the loss of hometown by northwestern (Sobugin ???) writers like Yi Kwangsu, who regularly code-switched to their local dialects, as well as to the Japanese language.","[Choi, Ellie] Harvard Univ, Korea Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Choi, Ellie] Cornell Univ, Korean Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Harvard University; Cornell University,"Choi, E (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Korean Literature & Culture, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Choi, E (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Korea Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eychoi@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,88,7,7,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-9118,1752-0401,,J ASIAN STUD,J.

Several protests since the 1980s in which the democratic-progressives were a leading force have been used as a source of historical analogies that have helped conservative journalists to interpret contemporary events and issues, including the 2008 vigil. These past protests were framed as anti-American, pro-North Korean leftist actions in the news stories. Some aspects of these past events were omitted - for example, former democratic-progressive activists' contribution to the democratisation process - while other aspects were emphasised, notably the violent nature of the earlier generation of activists. In addition, conservative journalists constructed a revisionist version of one particular past protest, the 2002 Korean Candlelight Vigil, and used it to serve present political purposes, conflating the rhetoric and language of the earlier protests into their reporting of the current protest. These discourse strategies helped to incorporate the current protest into a larger discourse of the threat posed by the leftists, which is embedded in the collective memory of Korean conservatives.","[Shin, Wooyeol] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Shin, W (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",shinx289@umn.edu,"Shin, Wooyeol/ABA-2429-2021","Shin, Wooyeol/0000-0003-3813-4103",,,,,43,7,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Profound structural changes in the international system have rendered North Korea incapable of addressing its security anxiety through either internal balancing by conventional arms buildup or external balancing by alliance formation. In this context, nuclearization offers a logical and inexpensive route for Pyongyang to restore the military balance in the Korean peninsula and ensure its own survival.","St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada",Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada,"Cho, Y (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",ycho@stfx.ca,,,,,,,44,6,8,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7020,2052-465X,,INT J-TORONTO,Int.

Five representative Hallyu 4.0 dramas are examined here, based on cultural globalization theory (e.g., hybridization), along with a review of some earlier studies of Korean dramas and relevant strands of feminist scholarship. The findings suggest that much of the moderately modern elements found in earlier waves of Korean drama are still present, while liberal or neoliberal feminist elements are manifest in all five shows, although to different degrees. This ideological shift, in part, reflects recent sociocultural changes.","[Boman, Bjorn] Stockholm Univ, Dept Educ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Boman, B (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Educ, Stockholm, Sweden.",bjorn.boman@edu.su.se,"; Boman, Björn/ACY-4962-2022","Boman, Bjorn/0000-0001-7529-6713;",,,,,58,4,4,4,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1225-9276,2377-004X,,ASIAN J WOMEN STUD,Asian J.

The practice of proxy adoption was born out of a loophole in U.S. immigration legislation, initially used by Americans to adopt European orphans after World War II. After the Korean War, the practice was again utilized to bring Korean children in even greater numbers to the United States. Through proxy adoption, adoptive parents bypassed the standard checkpoints of the adoption process as established by U.S. social welfare agencies. Although initially hailed as a humane practice, proxy adoption was ultimately banned in 1961 after a successful antiproxy adoption campaign waged by a coalition of social welfare workers, Catholic leaders, and U.S. senators. The role of Catholic agencies in this debate is essential, yet remains largely unexplored. This article sheds light on this significant and underresearched history of the Catholic institutions involved in the proxy adoption debate. The Catholic agencies, namely the National Catholic Welfare Conference and the Catholic Committee for Refugees, stood apart from both the government social welfare establishment and other humanitarian actors. Their actions must instead be understood through the context of their own institutional history of domestic social welfare programs and overseas humanitarian work, dating from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This article analyzes their relationship with the U.S. social welfare establishment, as well as joint advocacy efforts to reform intercountry adoption practices.","[Choi, Cathi] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Choi, C (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cchoi@jda.law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,61,3,4,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0898-0306,1528-4190,,J POLICY HIST,J.

By examining household registers and genealogies, I investigate the status of women who married into the families of Japanese and Ming Chinese immigrants and the social consequences of such marriages. The results unexpectedly indicate that immigrant families rarely intermarried, preferring integration with local families. As a means of acquiring social and cultural capital, Korean brides from elite families were vital to the success of immigrant families in forming social networks and in producing candidates for the civil service examinations, with failure to obtain such a bride proving a potential long-term obstacle to social advancement. There is a noticeable difference between families of Chinese and Japanese origin in this context due to the preference shown by Korean families for the descendants of Ming generals over Japanese defectors. Contributing to a growing number of studies that question whether the Korean family was fully Confucianized in the seventeenth century with a consequent decline in the status of women, this study argues that women possessed social and cultural capital and held particular value for immigrant families.","[Han, Sangwoo] Ajou Univ, Dept Hist, Dasan Hall 206, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Ajou University,"Han, S (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Hist, Dasan Hall 206, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",hansw@ajou.ac.kr,,"Han, Sangwoo/0000-0003-2921-1939",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [758347]; European Research Council (ERC) [758347] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),This work received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (No 758347).,,62,2,2,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1479-5914,1479-5922,,INT J ASIAN STUD,Int.

The sport spread to schools through games played against the YMCA team. However, baseball games were banned until the end of World War II due to the Baseball Control Proposal, enacted in 1932, and the war mobilization effort due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Immediately following the end of World War II, baseball was restored in Korea along with the desire of the Korean people to establish an independent country. The US Military Government tried to propagate the idea that their governing system was based on liberty, unlike the empire of Japan, by hosting cultural projects such as the Jomi Baseball Game. From this perspective, cultural forms, such as a baseball, were inseparably linked to the political strategy of the US Military Government during the outset of the Cold War, which led to the establishment of a liberal democratic independent country.","[Cho, Moongi] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Cho, M (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea.",ultrajo74@naver.com,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,5,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1087-1659,1543-2947,,SPORT HIST REV,Sport Hist.

Currently, the Korean IR scholarships no longer rely on just importing foreign thoughts and ideas.

Second, such research cannot be completed within academic circles alone. Hundreds and hundreds of civilian sectors are raising their voices, especially in democratic environments. Scholars are required to have open-mindedness to these demands. Third, we need to promote cooperation with other countries, including Japan and China, as South Korea needs to combine expertise on Korean issues with broader knowledge of the world in the contemporary era when global communications are more urgently needed than ever before. With regard to policies, South Korea, in a state of national division, has constantly been faced with threats - military and political - from North Korea. The Korean IR scholarship is required to devote itself to finding proper ways to promote peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula. Thus, scholars of Korean IR are urged to continuously carry out their historical mission of offering wide-ranging suggestions for external policies for the nation and the East Asian region.","[Kook, Kim Hyung; Young, Cho Yun] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Kook, KH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,14,9,9,0,7,"INHA UNIV, CTR INT STUDIES",INCHEON,"NO 253 YONGHYUN-DONG, NAM-KU, INCHEON, 402-751, SOUTH KOREA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

However, little is known about how NKRs perceive support. We aim to understand how support exchange and reciprocity evolve throughout NKR migration trajectories and how they are related to psychological well-being. From September to December 2019, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 NKRs and 20 of their South Korean (SK) acquaintances. We analyzed data using a grounded theory approach. Prior to arrival in South Korea, NKRs resided in mutually interdependent communities where reciprocation of support was a moral norm. However, support exchange became predominantly unidirectional in South Korea, with NKRs becoming recipients and SKs being givers. Several NKRs expressed discomfort with being dependent on others, preventing them from requesting support when it was needed. SKs also described distress from not receiving minimum levels of reciprocity or gratitude. Some NKRs managed this unease through reciprocating either to the giver or to others in need. Acts of reciprocity were described as sources of happiness, satisfaction, and pleasure, increasing self-esteem. Overall, exchange of support and reciprocity within one's social network may be important and yet overlooked features of relationships that contribute to psychological well-being of NKRs.","[Park, Soim; Surkan, Pamela J.] Johns Hopkins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wenzel, Jennifer A.] Johns Hopkins Sch Nursing, 525 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kim, Jin-Won] Natl Med Ctr, Dept Korean Med, 245 Euljiro, Seoul 04564, South Korea",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; National Medical Center - Korea,"Surkan, PJ (corresponding author), 615 N Wolfe St,Off 410-502-7396, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",soim.park@jhu.edu; jwenzel1@jh.edu; jinwon.kim@nmc.or.kr; psurkan@jhu.edu,,,International Fellowships from the American Association of University Women; Center for Qualitative Studies in Health and Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,International Fellowships from the American Association of University Women; Center for Qualitative Studies in Health and Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"This work was supported by the International Fellowships from the American Association of University Women, and the Dissertation Enhancement Award from the Center for Qualitative Studies in Health and Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",,47,0,0,1,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0147-1767,1873-7552,,INT J INTERCULT REL,Int.

By the end of the decade the Presbyteries determined how the home funds would be spent on evangelical work and Korean church leaders sat on a Joint Board with the Canadians to aid in the management of the mission. The Canadian decision to share power with the Koreans was made out of necessity. Throughout the 1920s, students, elders, ministers and a large segment of the laity vigorously, sometimes violently, advocated for a transformation of mission policies. The Canadians became extremely fearful and concluded that to save the mission they would have to reform their methods. In the literature published on the mission, the 'positive side' of the story, namely the Canadian ability to empathise with the Koreans and their denouncements of the Japanese colonial regime in 1919 as well as 1920, has been emphasised. This article focuses on the less seemly nature of the Canadian-Korean relationship. It will examine the temporal factors that contributed to the Korean acceptance of missionary authority before 1919, their rejection of it in the 1920s and the attempts of the Canadians to bring order back to the mission compounds. The ultimate purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Korean Christians were active agents who through their protests during the 1920s came to assume a prominent position within the mission.","[Glover, Frederick J.] Univ Calgary, Dept Hist, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Glover, Frederick J.] Univ Calgary, Courses World Hist, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Glover, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Hist, Calgary, AB, Canada.;Glover, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Courses World Hist, Calgary, AB, Canada.",fjglover@ucalgary.ca,"Glover, Frederick/AAS-2123-2021",,,,,,40,3,3,0,1,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND",1354-9901,1750-0230,,STUD WORLD CHRIST,Stud.

Since that time, the NLL has been a source of contention between North and South Korea culminating in two naval clashes in 1999 and 2002. A solution to the NLL dispute in the near future is unlikely so long as the security situation remains the same. North Korea may have a reasonable complaint, and an international tribunal would likely draw the line farther south, though not as far as Pyongyang desires. So long as North Korea remains a serious security threat, South Korea will be reluctant to make any changes. The most likely solution will be a negotiated settlement, but this will require North Korea to demonstrate its willingness to compromise on its position. Pyongyang should continue to state its opposition to the current NLL, but through diplomatic channels that do not threaten security while also taking steps to improve the overall security situation in the region.

Issues and Implications of North Korea's Position on 'Hostile Relations Between Two States',ASIAN PERSPECTIVE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Kim Jong-un; Workers' Party of Korea; Supreme People's Assembly; North Korea policy toward South Korea; inter-Korean relations; unification,,"In 2024, North Korea deleted 'unification strategy' from its national strategy and declared its pursuit of a policy toward South Korea founded on the recognition of two states coexisting on the Korean Peninsula, thus disregarding South Korea as a counterpart for reconciliation and unification. This fundamental policy shift toward South Korea is based on an aggressive perception of the current political situation, and appears to be a mid-to-long term strategic level decision. Since the failure of the US-North Korea summit meeting in Hanoi in 2019, North Korea appears to be cultivating a new identity for itself as a self-reliant 'nuclear power' in order to gain superiority over South Korea, pressure the United States, and gain recognition as a nuclear state from the international community. Pyongyang seeks superiority over Seoul by contrasting North Korea's 'great power identity' as an independent socialist country with South Korea's 'colonial identity'as a capitalist colony of the United States. This fundamental policy shift will inevitably affect South Korea's overall national strategy, including Seoul's diplomatic, security, and unification strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,1,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0258-9184,2288-2871,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,FAL,2024,48,4,,,,,,,,10.1353/anp.2024.a944266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/anp.2024.a944266,,,26,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,Q0Q2Z,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001381834600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study identified factors of presenteeism among workers in South Korea, especially in relation to exposure to adverse social behaviors. Here, an adverse social behavior refers to any forms of workplace violence or intimidation. This study used the data from 23,164 full-time salaried employees, who participated in the fifth Korean Working Conditions Survey. This study attempted to predict presenteeism based on the exposure to adverse social behaviors and working conditions using logistic regression. Presenteeism was reported in 15.9% of the sample. Presenteeism was significantly higher among workers with the following characteristics: females, aged 40 years or older; middle school graduates; over 40 working hours a week; shift workers; no job-related safety information received; exposure to adverse social behavior and discrimination; and those with a high demand for quantitative work, low job autonomy, high emotional demands, and high job stress. The workers exposed to adverse social behavior showed a higher prevalence of presenteeism (41.2%), and low job autonomy was the most significant predictor of presenteeism. The findings of this study suggest that allowing enough autonomy in job-related roles may help alleviate presenteeism among those who have experienced adverse social behavior at work.","[Yi, Jee-Seon; Kim, Hyeoneui] Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, Durham, NC 27710 USA",Duke University,"Yi, JS; Kim, H (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",jeeseon.yi@gmail.com; hyeoneui.kim@duke.edu,"Kim, Hyeoneui/NOE-3592-2025","Kim, Hyeoneui/0000-0002-5931-7286",,,,,48,17,17,5,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

It shows that developmental ideas and policy preferences established during the developmental phase of the country's post-war history have continued to play a critical role in determining the nature and extent of Korean welfare reforms. Examples of such developmental ideas and preferences include those favouring work-incentive contributions and self-support discipline, both of which economic bureaucrats have consistently advocated even after the Korean developmental state was transformed into more liberalised governance. Examining two welfare innovations in Korea, this study concludes that embedded values do not easily perish and dominant values within a bureaucracy can filter, shape and restrict policy demands from civil society. In particular, the findings indicate that following the political decisions of the executive, Korean bureaucrats have enjoyed considerable autonomy in the phase of making up enforcement ordinances and regulations with the rationale for growth strategy in the post-developmental era.","[Heo, Yong-Chang] Keimyung Univ, Dept Social Welf, Daegu, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hyeb] Inje Univ, Dept Publ Serv, Gimhae, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea",Keimyung University; Inje University,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Inje Univ, Dept Publ Serv, Gimhae, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea.",ezr91@inje.ac.kr,,,,,,,65,6,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Fieldwork based on in-depth interviews reveals that NGOs play a pivotal role in carrying out the state-led resettlement project at the local level. As disciplinary agents, NGOs mirror the state's policy in their emphasis on self-sufficiency and workfare as they encourage North Koreans to become economically productive citizens. Concomitantly, they emphasize civic contributions and volunteerism as a remedy for improving the social reputation of North Koreans as welfare recipients to that of contributing citizens. This focus on active, responsible citizenship aims at disciplining North Koreans to become docile subjects at the bottom of the social ladder, despite persistent economic difficulties and social marginalization in South Korea. Thus, refugees are pressured not only to achieve economic self-sufficiency, but to contribute to society in order to claim their sociocultural citizenship.","Dept Sociol, Torrance, CA 90506 USA",,"Lee, JE (corresponding author), Dept Sociol, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd, Torrance, CA 90506 USA.",jlee@elcamino.edu,"Lee, Jung-Seok/L-6826-2019",,Northeast Asian Council through a Korean Studies Grant,Northeast Asian Council through a Korean Studies Grant,This work was supported by funding from the Northeast Asian Council through a Korean Studies Grant in 2012.,,51,14,17,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-9870,1466-4356,,ETHNIC RACIAL STUD,Ethn.

It argues that the contributions of Zainichi researchers have often been overlooked in the history of South Korean science due to the complexity of their identity politics for South Korea, as they sought to navigate the political risks caused by the Cold War and postcolonial context. Facing ethnic discrimination in the Japanese labor market from the late 1950s onward, many Zainichi Koreans with science and engineering degrees sought jobs in South Korea. However, their ties to pro-North Korean organizations raised suspicions about their loyalty. Further, they were often seen as representatives of new Japanese economic and cultural imperialism, particularly after the normalization of relations between Japan and South Korea in 1965. To navigate these challenges, Zainichi researchers often downplayed their Zainichi identity, presenting themselves as Korean students abroad. Those lacking the necessary cultural capital to do so faced greater difficulties adapting to South Korea, with their contributions frequently ignored due to fears of potential links to North Korea. By highlighting the New Korea Academic Research Society and two Zainichi researchers, Park Bong-ryol (1926- 2001) and Kim Chul-woo (1926-2013), this article sheds light on the self-fashioning strategies used by Zainichi scientists and the political factors that led to their marginalization in the history of scientific interactions between Japan and South Korea.","[Hyun, Jaehwan] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Liberal Educ, Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Hyun, J (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Liberal Educ, Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.",jhwanhyun@pusan.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [2023K2A9A2A08000202],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"I would like to express my gratitude to Hiromi Mizuno, one anonymous referee, and the journal editors for their insightful suggestions, which significantly contributed to the clarity of the arguments presented in this article.

Following Sino-American normalization, Pyongyang abruptly agreed to revive inter-Korean dialogue and rapidly rejected Carter's proposal for North Korea-U.S.-South Korea trilateral talks.

However, despite these developments, South Korea retains a strong emphasis on public linguistic homogeneity in standard (Seoul-based) Korean, its national language, and related linguistic hierarchies of prestige that privilege this standard at the expense of other Korean language varieties. This combination is demonstrated clearly in the case of North Korean refugees to South Korea. Despite speaking the same language, their dialect and accent are consistently pathologized in South Korean higher education (HE) and the wider society. This article reports on a study of the experiences of linguistic discrimination faced by North Korean refugee students in South Korean HE, its often-negative consequences on North Korean students' social and academic identities, and their strategies for mitigating and, at times, actively contesting this discrimination. The article concludes that, despite South Korea's increasing demographic and, related, linguistic diversity, little has been achieved yet in addressing, and changing, the endemic linguistic discrimination that North Koreans face daily in HE and the wider South Korean society.","[Park, Mi Yung] Univ Auckland, Asian Studies, Auckland, New Zealand; [May, Stephen] Univ Auckland, Te Puna Wananga, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Park, MY (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Asian Studies, Auckland, New Zealand.",my.park@auckland.ac.nz,,"May, Stephen/0000-0002-4490-5093",Academy of Korean Studies10.13039/501100019898 [2024]; Academy of Korean Studies,Academy of Korean Studies10.13039/501100019898; Academy of Korean Studies,This research was conducted with the support of the Academy of Korean Studies (2024).,,45,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0790-8318,1747-7573,,LANG CULT CURRIC,Lang.

However, social and cultural factors predicting suicidality among North Korean refugees are not well known. Thus, we explored how social networks affect suicidal ideation in a sample of 405 North Korean refugees in South Korea using egocentric network data. Network diversity (number of different types of ties) was a protective factor for suicidal ideation among women. Having a help-providing and trustworthy church-based tie was a protective factor for women, whereas it was a risk factor for men. It is likely that women connected to people in diverse social contexts received more support to effectively deal with adversities. Because South Korean churches provide tailored worship services and financial aid to North Korean refugees, women might receive emotional comfort from church-based ties whom they can trust and receive help from, whereas men might become distressed about being financially dependent on others, which contradicts cultural expectations of a man's traditional role. Our findings have implications for mental health practitioners serving vulnerable populations, and highlight the importance of understanding the cultural context of social networks and gender in suicide research.","[Um, Mee Young] Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Work, Watts Coll Publ Serv & Community Solut, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Rice, Eric; Lee, Jungeun Olivia] Univ Southern Calif, Suzanne Dworak Peck Sch Social Work, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Kim, Hee Jin; Palinkas, Lawrence A.] Univ Southern Calif, Suzanne Dworak Peck Sch Social Work, Social Policy & Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Kim, Hee Jin] Myongji Univ, Sci Community Studies Disadvantaged & Minor Grp, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; Myongji University,"Kim, HJ (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, 116 Myongji Ro, Yongin 449728, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",kjoie@mju.ac.kr,"Um, Mee/AAV-6838-2021; Kim, Hee Jin/P-2272-2014","Kim, Hee Jin/0000-0003-0517-2461",National Research Foundation of Korea - South Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2042790],National Research Foundation of Korea - South Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr. Hee Jin Kim was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the South Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2042790).",,51,12,12,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1363-4615,1461-7471,,TRANSCULT PSYCHIATRY,Transcult.

Background: While there are significant concerns about HPV infection, lower immunization rates, and higher cervical cancer risks facing KAs, limited attention has been paid to the specific concerns of KA parents and barriers that underlie parental reluctance to vaccinate their children. Methods: A descriptive comparative design was used in a convenience sample of 74 KA parents. The study questionnaire consisted of demographic items, general knowledge of HPV, and parental perception regarding HPV vaccination. Results: The level of general knowledge about HPV was very low with a mean score of 3.14 out of 10. Many participants reported negative perception toward HPV vaccination. HPV knowledge scores were not significantly different between parents who did vaccinate their children compared to parents who did not. However, scores for perceived benefits and perceived barriers to vaccination were found to be significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: A lack of knowledge about HPV and negative perception of the HPV vaccination play a key role in preventing many KA parents from seeking appropriate information and delaying vaccination. Development of a culturally grounded and sensitive HPV education program is critical to improve and implement preventive measures for HPV in this population.","[Lee, Young-Me] Depaul Univ, Sch Nursing, 990 W Fullerton Ave, Chicago, IL 60640 USA; [Riesche, Laren] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, 3400 Civ Blvd,TRC 9-172, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lee, Hyeonkyeong] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Dept Nursing Environm & Syst, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120752, South Korea; [Shim, Kaka] Univ Illinois, Coll Nursing, 845 S Damen Ave, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",DePaul University; University of Pennsylvania; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Lee, YM (corresponding author), Depaul Univ, Sch Nursing, 990 W Fullerton Ave, Chicago, IL 60640 USA.",ylee23@depaul.edu; laren@pennmedicine.upenn.edu; hlee39@yuhs.ac; kshim8@uic.edu,,"Lee, Hyeonkyeong/0000-0001-9558-7737; (Riesche) Narapareddy, Laren/0000-0002-3327-4089; KAKA, SHIM/0000-0003-4560-381X",,,,,27,16,17,1,15,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0897-1897,1532-8201,,APPL NURS RES,Appl.

This paper examines the cultural-semiotic rendering of an abstract, kinesthetic quality called shiwonham into medical efficacy through acupuncture treatments, observed through ethnographic fieldwork in a TKM clinic. By employing the conceptual framework of qualia, I argue that shiwonham in TKM clinic is the sign of efficacy expressed through the body, both in linguistic and synesthetic forms. The analysis of shiwonham also reveals the semiotics of change: the qualitative dynamics of changes-of-state and the cultural change across generations in Korean society. I examine an extended interaction observed in a TKM clinic, during which a young patient learns to experience and interpret the senses and sounds of shiwonham as a sign of efficacy through conversations with an older family member and the doctor. This interaction illustrates how participants attempt to bridge their intergenerational, interpretative gaps about the relevant qualia and the conventional qualisign of shiwonham. Together through this semiotic analysis of shiwonham, I show how central shiwonham is to the expressive evidence for TKM, that is, culturally legible evidence of efficacy reflecting modes of awareness, expression, and the value of a sensation.","[Lee, Hyemin] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Lee, H (corresponding author), NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",hyeminlee@nyu.edu,,"Lee, Hyemin/0000-0002-7479-104X",Anthropology Grant at Seoul National University; Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM); Integrative Medicine (IM) special interest group of the Society of Medical Anthropology through the 2020 CAM/IM Graduate Student Paper Prize,Anthropology Grant at Seoul National University; Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM); Integrative Medicine (IM) special interest group of the Society of Medical Anthropology through the 2020 CAM/IM Graduate Student Paper Prize,"I am indebted to my interlocutors from Willow Clinic, especially Doctor Jeong and the many patients who guided me through the world of shiwonham.

It argues that Korea has become 'a new kind of patron state', which emulates the existing patron states in the West firmly within the statist framework and ambitiously renders government-led growth of cultural industries (and the Korean Wave) as a new responsibility of the state. The formation of Korea's new patron state has been driven by a 'parallel movement' consisting of democracy and the market economy, which has defined the political and socio-economic trajectory of Korean society itself since the 1990s. Democracy has been articulated in cultural policy as cultural freedom, cultural enjoyment and the arm's length principle; meanwhile, the market economy of culture has been facilitated by a 'dynamic push' of the state. After discussing the parallel movement, the article points out the tension, ambiguity and contradiction entailed in cultural policy of the new patron state.","[Lee, Hye-Kyung] Kings Coll London, Culture Media & Creat Ind, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lee, HK (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Culture Media & Creat Ind, London WC2R 2LS, England.",hk.lee@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,13,14,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

The main argument is that China wishes to maintain the regional status quo while appearing to adjust its position in line with the international community. China's current duplicity stems from its different priorities and concerns to the remainder of the world, and can best be explained using a role theory analysis.","[Mehmetcik, Hakan; Belder, Ferit] Marmara Univ, Dept Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Mehmetcik, H (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Dept Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey.",hakan.mehmetcik@marmara.edu.tr,,"MEHMETCIK, HAKAN/0000-0002-1882-4003",,,,,49,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-6597,1360-2241,,THIRD WORLD Q,Third World Q.,,2018,39,12,,,SI,,2255,2271,,10.1080/01436597.2018.1522955,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2018.1522955,,,17,Development Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies,HM8FV,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000459715200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach that compares the cohorts born before and after the war, we find that direct exposure to wartime violence induces negative perceptions regarding perpetrator countries. As many of the civilian massacres were committed by the South Korean armed forces, prewar cohorts living in violence-ridden areas during the war demonstrate significantly less pride in South Korea today. In contrast, postwar cohorts from those violent areas, who were exposed to intensive anti-communist campaigns and were incentivized to differentiate themselves from the victims, show significantly greater pride in South Korea, and greater hospitality toward the United States than toward North Korea, compared to prewar cohorts in the same areas and to the same cohorts born in non-violent areas.","[Kang, Woo Chang] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hong, Ji Yeon] HKUST, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Kang, WC (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"; Hong, Ji Yeon/AFN-3448-2022","Hong, Ji Yeon (Jean)/0000-0002-2104-7161;",,,,,69,3,4,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1598-2408,2234-6643,,J EAST ASIAN STUD,J.

Reflecting on interviews spanning over two decades with North Korean migrants in South Korea and China, a team of North Korea experts has identified the patterns of microlevel bribery in everyday life in North Korea that differ, to some extent, from those of other postcommunist states in Eastern Europe and Asia. By carefully examining the accounts of ten former North Korean residents, the researchers find that the traditional socialist economy, once prevalent in workplaces, schools, and hospitals, has now been supplanted by individual-to-individual private market interactions. Moreover, bribery serves not only as an informal practice but also as a moral economy, which differs from the more organized forms of corruption seen at the elite and enterprise levels.","[Song, Jay; Yoon, Boyoung; Kim, Sungkyung] Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Zulawnik, Adam] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Yoon, B (corresponding author), Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",wiseflower76@gmail.com,"; Zulawnik, Adam/KMX-2059-2024; Song, Jay/AAA-2094-2020","Zulawnik, Adam/0000-0002-6335-635X; Song, Jay/0000-0003-4964-677X;",Seed Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS- 2019-INC- 2230009]; Collective Research Grant of the University of Melbourne; Ministry of Unification; National Research Foundation of Korea under the Ministry of Education in South Korea [NRF- 2018S1A5B8070196]; Singapore Ministry of Education,"Seed Program of the Academy of Korean Studies; Collective Research Grant of the University of Melbourne; Ministry of Unification(Ministry of Unification, Repubic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea under the Ministry of Education in South Korea; Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The study is funded by the Seed Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS- 2019-INC- 2230009) and the Collective Research Grant of the University of Melbourne.

The results indicate that only exposure to a North Korean male accent, not a North Korean female accent, strengthened stereotypes about North Koreans among South Koreans prior to the summit.

It analyses three South Korean artists, Kang Yo-bae, Suh Yongsun and Jeon Seung-il, who produced paintings that made direct reference to the grievous and unjust civilian deaths, a taboo subject that is still controversial in a society bound by the unfinished war. This article seeks to contribute to the critical inquiry into the long-delayed yet urgent issue of historical injustice from the perspective of visual representation. It draws attention to the following questions: how the artists establish relations with the violent past, vicariously and retrospectively; how they represent the grievous deaths in critical, imaginative and affective modes of visual expression; and how their paintings participate in a socially engaged act of ethical witnessing. The article further considers how their works are in dialogue with and simultaneously depart from the official investigative attempts in approaching the notion of truth. It argues that the paintings enact a communicative practice of mourning that mediates the living and the dead, without anticipating premature reconciliation.","[Kal, Hong] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Kal, H (corresponding author), York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",hongkal@yorku.ca,,,Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2018-OLU-2250001],"Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2018-OLU-2250001).,,34,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

These two films expose the dark underbelly of financial capitalism not only by revealing existing predicaments and challenges caused by the credit crisis, but also by analyzing the current neoliberal social order. Neo-liberalism developed in Korea after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was justified by the IMF bailout fund received by the Korean government to escape sovereign default. Korean financial thrillers scrutinize global capitalism from a nationalist perspective, considering the neo-liberal social formation as a type of colonial rule by developing an anti-colonial narrative. Nonetheless, their views are not limited to a nationalist scope, and they define the current exploitative logic as a distinctive one that deviates from that of former colonial relationships. They understand the neo-liberal economy as a governmentality that can displace national sovereignty, and they explore potential contre-conduites against it.","[Kim, Jaecheol] Yonsei Univ, English, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, English, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0847-5911,2561-424X,,CAN J FILM STUD,Can.

Most of the reforms in the Kim Jong-il era, including the July 1, 2002 Economic Management Improvement Measure (EMIM), failed. In comparison, its policy reforms have been reinstituted since the June 28 Measure of 2012 in the Kim Jong-un era, and the policy frame in North Korea has been changed with more focus on civilian economic growth. Drawing on the policy framing approach, this article explores policy changes in the Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un eras and analyzes the features of a policy frame in each era in three aspects: framing contention, processes, and tasks. The findings imply that a new policy frame, formed on the Kangsong Taeguk doctrine, has been applied to recent policy changes since 2012 in North Korea in order for reforms to be stably instituted.","[Park, Sauk-Hee] Catholic Univ Korea, Seoul, South Korea",Catholic University of Korea,"Park, SH (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Korea, Seoul, South Korea.",nice113@catholic.ac.kr,,,Catholic University of Korea,Catholic University of Korea,This work was funded by the 2017 research grant of the Catholic University of Korea.

While a growing body of research offers alternative perspectives about markets from the neoclassical perspective, it ignores the degree of embeddedness of the state in markets. In view of this theoretical gap, we investigate the market-shaping activities of states in emerging economies. Our context is the creation of a Korean cultural product market in Vietnam. Based on a document analysis of the nation branding projects of Korea and Vietnam, we investigate how these states are involved in shaping Vietnamese markets for Korean cultural products through their international and national activities. The findings reveal that whereas the Korean state is mobilizing and building diplomatic ties to promote the Korea's image in Vietnam through its cultural products, the Vietnamese state profits from these products for its East Asian oriented cultural policy. Three actions are being taken by the Vietnamese state: (1) controlling the distribution of Korean cultural pro-ducts, (2) framing media producers' and consumers' behaviors, and (3) creating a network of collaboration between selected Korean and Vietnamese media producers. Through their nation branding practices, the Vietnamese and Korean states act as institutional entrepreneurs in shaping the Vietnamese market for Korean cultural products.","[Nguyen, Arthur] Univ Lyon, UJML3, Iaelyon Sch Management, 1C Ave Freres Lumiere,CS 78242, F-69372 Lyon 08, France; [Ozcaglar-Toulouse, Nil] Univ Lille, ULR 4112, LSMRC, F-5900 Lille, France",SKEMA Business School; Universite de Lille,"Nguyen, A (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, UJML3, Iaelyon Sch Management, 1C Ave Freres Lumiere,CS 78242, F-69372 Lyon 08, France.",Arthur.Nguyen@univ-lyon3.fr; Nil.Toulouse@univ-lille.fr,"; NGUYEN, Arthur/KXS-6535-2024","NGUYEN, Arthur/0000-0002-2796-7479;",,,,,113,19,20,3,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0148-2963,1873-7978,,J BUS RES,J.

This includes all the more complicated debates on the issue of the neutralized reunification of the two antagonistic Koreas raised intermittently since the forced division of the Korean peninsula in 1945. All the previous initiatives to neutralize the Korean peninsula, including the official US decision to reunify Korea via neutralization around the time of Armistice of the Korean War in 1953, have failed due to: (i) the lack of external consensus among the neighbors; and/or (ii) the lack of internal consensus between the two Koreas (or even among South Koreans) by themselves. This article highlights the necessity of the initial neutralization of South Korea alone (NSKA) absent in the previous discussions, and argues not only that NSKA would facilitate the process towards the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas via Austria-like permanent neutrality, but also that it is necessary to achieve NSKA first and maintain it for a considerable time before hurriedly pursuing a simultaneously neutralized reunification of the two Koreas. The permanent and upgradable NSKA (in a long-term process of the neutralized reunification of the Korean peninsula) at the initial stage would greatly reduce tensions in Northeast Asia, and would heighten the probability of reunification. This article intends to form an epistemic community for NSKA, which can be a startup towards a long-term process for Korean reunification and peaceful coexistence among the four major powers.",,,,,"Yoon, Tae-Ryong/ABI-8500-2020",,,,,,52,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

But Asian American literary studies has been flourishing only from the 1990s thanks to Korean scholars' interest in overseas Korean literatures, the centennial of Korean immigration to the US in 2003, and the rise of Asian American literary studies in the US. An analysis of the articles and book-length studies shows the general trends of Asian American literary studies in Korea: Korean scholars are interested more in close readings of individual texts than in general, intraethnic, interethnic, and interracial studies; they prefer narratives to plays and poems; they focus on Korean American literature; they study not only Anglophone Korean American literature but also Korean-language American texts. Korean scholars' focus on Korean American literature significantly points at new directions in Asian American literary studies-towards broader, comparative, transnational, and translingual readings of Asian American texts. In conclusion, Korean scholars have actively participated in the international discursive networks of scholars interested in Asian American literature with their uniquely Korean perspectives.","Korea Univ, Dept English, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, KJ (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept English, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",,"Lee, Jongwon/V-6800-2018",,,,,,68,7,7,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1464-9373,,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

What made Beijing jettison its traditional friendship with Pyongyang and recognize Seoul? What did China want from Sino-South Korea normalization? By extensively unearthing hitherto unknown archival evidence, this paper argues that it was China's security concern about being besieged by pro-Soviet powers, rather than an ideological affinity with North Korea, that delayed Sino-South Korea rapprochement. In the same vein, the study posits that it was the gradual Sino-Soviet reconciliation from 1985 onwards that enabled Beijing to reconcile with Seoul. Furthermore, it argues that in the face of the sudden dissolution of the Eastern bloc and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Beijing hastily sought to secure a cordon sanitaire and foreclose the possibility of the formation of a US-Japan-South Korea anti-China united front by normalizing relations with Seoul.","[Son, Daekwon] Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Son, D (corresponding author), Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",sondaekwon@sogang.ac.kr,,,School of Advanced International and Area Studies of East China Normal University; 2021 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2021-OLU-2250005],School of Advanced International and Area Studies of East China Normal University; 2021 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies,"The author would like to thank Kim Donggil, Shen Zhihua, Stephen Smith, Wang Dong, Yang Xiangfeng, Han Yongjon, Cheng Hyunwook and the two anonymous reviewers for their support and constructive comments on the earlier draft of this article.

With reference to the political role of NGOs in constructivist theory, I identify three factors that have hindered the formation of a sustainable partnership between the South Korean government and NGOs since the inter-Korean summit of 2000. First, South Korean NGOs have lacked consistent efforts toward transparency and accountability in operations and organizational management. Second, the great increase in inter-Korean cooperation and exchange after 2000 weakened the research, education, and advocacy function of NGOs.

I use the Integrated Data for Events Analysis dataset for the period 1990-2004. By employing a Vector Autoregression model, which analyzes the behavioral patterns of South and North Korea and the United States, I find that US foreign policy affects the relationship between the two Koreas by affecting North Korea's behavior toward South Korea. The triangular relationship among the United States, North Korea, and South Korea shows a reciprocal behavior pattern.

The consolidation of nuclear and missile capabilities by North Korea points to the need for a new strategy to mitigate the potential for conflict: to pursue progress toward peace and denuclearization simultaneously. The most appropriate mechanism for implementing such a strategy is arms control, defined here as a progressive series of restrictions, limitations and constraints on arms (nuclear and conventional) and associated steps that reduce the risks of conflict and insulate relations against crises and escalation. Detractors of arms control for North Korea argue that it would convey status as a possessor of nuclear weapons, and that it would require accepting some level of mutual deterrence. States would need to consider such criticisms as they weigh the risks and costs of pursuing arms control compared to alternatives such as containment and deterrence. An arms control-oriented roadmap would integrate parallel progress on establishing a durable peace regime and capping and then reducing the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons. Monitoring and verifying compliance with this type of roadmap would require a hybrid approach drawing on both traditional safeguards-style methods and novel approaches designed to build confidence.","[Kim, Youngjun] Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Nucl Policy Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA; Korea Natl Def Univ, Natl Secur Coll, Nonsan Si, South Korea",,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Nucl Policy Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",tdalton@ceip.org; bumanbake@hotmail.com,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,4,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

The starting point should be the mutual recognition of each other's complete sovereignty between South Korea and North Korea, and between the U.S. and North Korea. The Korean Peace Agreement further aims at the final denuclearization of North Korea. The former is a very pragmatic vehicle for the latter.

The Korea-U.S. alliance is no exception, having adapted to the post-Cold War international security environment and continually seeking a new alliance vision. Based on the assumption that the Cold-War security threats still exist, Korea chose to consolidate its bilateral alliance with the United States in lieu of multilateralism or confidence-building measures among regional states. The problem, however, is that while the Korea-U.S. alliance has evolved into a relationship that encompasses economic, social and cultural cooperation in the post-Cold War period, South Korea's core security interest-the improvement of inter-Korean relations and the realization of peace on the Korean Peninsula-cannot be attained. This is because the strengthening of Korea-U.S. military deterrence against North Korea can unintentionally justify North Korea's nuclear development as well as constant reproduction of crisis, on the grounds that it intensifies the threat perception of the North. At this time of its sixtieth anniversary, the goals and identity of the Korea-U.S. alliance need to be reconsidered in order to reflect the changing security situation. While maintaining the deterrence against the North through an elaborate cooperation system, the alliance needs to set more creative goals that include the realization of human security on the Korean Peninsula or the formation of a Northeast Asian security community.","Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Ihn-hwi, P (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",ihpark@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,51,0,2,1,20,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Early detection is important for treatment. Accordingly, although various factors affecting adolescents' GAD have been studied, the body of research is fragmented, and an integrated analysis of the influencing factors is needed. Therefore, in this study, we intended to analyze various factors affecting GAD. (2) Methods: Using data from the Korea Youth Health Behavior Survey (2021), sociodemographic factors, negative emotion, and physical activity factors were selected. Correlation analysis, t-test, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis were performed using SPSS 26.0. (3) Results: Perceived stress was found to be the factor that had the greatest influence on GAD. (4) Conclusions: The risk of GAD in Korean adolescents was found to increase in female students who had higher levels of perceived stress, and participated in less high-intensity or muscle-strengthening exercise.","[Kim, Mi-Lyang] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Sport Leisure & Recreat, Asan 315358, Chungcheong Do, South Korea; [Shin, Kyulee] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sports Sci, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Soonchunhyang University; Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Shin, K (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sports Sci, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",mlkim@sch.ac.kr; kyuleeshin@seoultech.ac.kr,,"Kim, Mi-Lyang/0000-0002-1364-7095",Soonchunhyang University Research Fund,Soonchunhyang University Research Fund,This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.,,23,10,10,0,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

J,"Chung, J",,,,"Chung, Jaewook",,,How to Resolve the North Korean Nuclear Issue: From a Commitment Problem Perspective,KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korean nuclear issue; commitment problems; US-North Korea negotiations; mediation; China,INTERESTS,"From a rationalist perspective, this paper analyzes the current nuclear stalemate between the United States and North Korea. Using a simple game theoretical model, this paper shows that the current deadlock emanates from a commitment problem, Pyongyang's concern that the United States will be unable to commit itself to following through on an agreement once Pyongyang has dismantled its nuclear programs, because Pyongyang's accommodation of the demand for denuclearization would imply not only the increased vulnerability of the North to U.S. military presence but also the undermining of its future bargaining power relative to that of the United States. Currently, the lack of a reliable enforcing mechanism to guarantee the implementation of a nuclear deal generates this commitment problem, making it more difficult for both sides to strike a deal. Thus, this paper offers three policy alternatives to minimize the commitment problem as a prerequisite to resolving the North Korean nuclear problem and making progress towards denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. First, minimizing the commitment problem requires bringing in a third party who is capable of securing the implementation of an agreement. Besides bringing in a third party, this paper also proposes two other ways to make reneging costly. The final agreement for a nuclear deal must be a legally binding agreement such as a treaty that requires U.S. domestic legislative approval and finally, North Korea must relinquish any economic aid from the United States to reduce the possibility that a nuclear deal made between them does not cause any U.S. domestic backlash against the deal.","[Chung, Jaewook] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Int Relat, Suwon, South Korea",Kyonggi University,"Chung, J (corresponding author), Kyonggi Univ, Dept Int Relat, Suwon, South Korea.",jwchungir@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,7,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

A joint Japanese and Korean Buddhist event sponsored by the state, it became the signature religious and state festival. Although much politicized, the festival was also a culmination of Buddhist efforts in Asia to respond to modernity, nationalism, colonialism, and Christian missions. Paralleling the reinvention of Christmas in the modern period, Buddhists reconfigured the Buddha's birthday as a symbol of their religious identity and power. The Buddha's Birthday festival should be understood in the context of increasing contact and exchange among Buddhists in the East and the West. The festival's prominence was the result of complex negotiation and collaboration between Korean and Japanese Buddhists who both hoped the festival would advance their overlapping visions of Buddhism. The festival was not so much an imposition of the colonizer on a native culture as it was a dynamic, creative feature of modern Korean Buddhism in the colonial context.","[Kim, Hwansoo] Duke Univ, Relig Dept, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Kim, Hwansoo] Duke Univ, Dept Asian & Middle Eastern Studies, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Relig Dept, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",Hwansoo.kim@duke.edu,,,,,,,67,3,6,0,4,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

The existing literature has emphasized the Korea Clause in explaining the Japanese commitment to the security of the ROK and the Japan-ROK military connection. However, I argue that the Korea Clause was merely political rhetoric initiated by Japan to neutralize the written Korean Minute. One of the key aims of US military policy toward Northeast Asia was to secure a free hand in using US forces and bases in Japan. In this context; the Korean Minute backed by the authority of the United Nations legalized the right of US forces to carry out sorties without prior consultation with the Japanese government in case of a Korean crisis. While Japan attempted to terminate the Korean Minute by politicizing it, the United States adopted a stance of benign neglect against it, especially by maintaining the United Nations Command.

Previous studies documented that North Korean refugees faced significant obstacles in resettlement because of maladjustment and marginalisation, socioeconomic status differences between the North and the South, prejudice, suspicion, national identity, and strong nationalism. This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors that impede or facilitate the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea using a holistic approach (i.e. market and means, social connections, facilitators, and foundations). To this end, we analysed a sample of 405 North Korean refugees. Univariate comparison of descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were performed. Factors such as foundations (i.e. citizenship and other rights) were found to have strong positive associations with successful resettlement after controlling for sociodemographics and other characteristics.

Relying on interviews conducted with 1.5/2nd-generation Korean American returnees', this study finds that an orientation toward the Korean peninsula and an abstracted Korean-ness serves as one of the central motivations for their migration to South Korea. I argue that this orientation and cultural affinity toward the Korean peninsula is not proof of a diasporic ontology but rather of a discursive reality promulgated by popular and legal discourses both in South Korea and the United States. Within these discourses, culture and ethnicity are interpreted not as being socially constructed and located but as essential and natural. Whether or not these perspectives hold ontological merit is thus superfluous-the Korean American returnees' interviewed believe them to be valid and articulate their salience within their own migration narratives. However, this article also finds that possessing an orientation toward a Korean ethnicity and peninsula does not preclude these individuals from eventually negotiating their migratory identities within and against an authentic' Korean diasporic subjectivity. These findings showcase how Korean American returnees' both adopt and challenge dominant discourses about ethnicity, nationality, and diaspora through their transnationalism.","[Suh, Stephen Cho] Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Womens & Ethn Studies Program, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Suh, SC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Womens & Ethn Studies Program, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.",ssuh@uccs.edu,,"Suh, Stephen/0000-0002-6400-1809",,,,,21,1,1,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1468-7968,1741-2706,,ETHNICITIES,Ethnicities,FEB,2022,22,1,,,,,66,83,1.4688E+15,10.1177/1468796820981667,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468796820981667,,DEC 2020,18,Ethnic Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Ethnic Studies,ZE8CB,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000608759300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using Egan Susanna's idea of mirror talk in contemporary autobiography and Gillian Whitlock's understanding of journalist memoirs, the essay demonstrates how Kim's merged voices of different generations and combined memoir with reportage that contains her family trauma involving the Korean War and her undercover story in North Korea, resonate mirror talk across generic, generational, and linguistic boundaries. These multiple interactions in the fluid narrative allow her to document the war stories of her own family traumatized by their loss, including her own story. But they also testify to the deprivation of human rights in North Korea within the Cold War context, bringing our attention to the continuing impact of the war and the 1953 armistice on all Koreans, on the Korean peninsula and elsewhere.","[Park, Heui-Yung] Dankook Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Park, HY (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Yongin, South Korea.",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,2,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, COLL INT STUDIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES",TAIPEI,"162 HEPING EAST RD, SECTION 1, TAIPEI, 106, TAIWAN",1729-6897,1729-8792,,CONCENTRIC,Concentric,SEP,2024,50,2,,,SI,,13,36,,10.6240/concentric.lit.202409_50(2).0002,http://dx.doi.org/10.6240/concentric.lit.202409_50(2).0002,,,24,Literary Theory & Criticism; Literature,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Literature,J2E0C,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001335238500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

From that moment on, Yeon became one of South Korea's most famous directors, winning over critics and international audiences. In this respect, this article investigates how the films of Yeon Sang-ho have collaborated in the creation and strengthening of a quality brand implicit in South Korean cinema, which, in turn, is assimilated by both critics and Spanish cinephiles. For this reason, we can observe the evolution of the reception of South Korean cinema through the generalist and specialised press over the last three decades. It also analyses the global vision that it has emitted on its filmography to extract the general trends between critics and the Spanish public as part of the reception of South Korean cinema in Spain.","[Duenas Mohedas, Sonia] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Madrid, Spain; [Duenas Mohedas, Sonia] TECMERIN, Res Grp Televis Cinema Memory Representat & Ind, Madrid, Spain; [Duenas Mohedas, Sonia] ADECCE, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Mohedas, SD (corresponding author), TECMERIN, Res Grp Televis Cinema Memory Representat & Ind, Madrid, Spain.",sduenas@hum.uc3m.es,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,2,ASOC CINEFORUM L ATALANTE,VALENCIA,"CALLE POETAS ANONIMOS, 10-8, VALENCIA, 46020, SPAIN",1885-3730,2340-6992,,ATALANTE,Atalante,JAN-JUN,2020,,29,,,,,67,83,,,,,,17,"Film, Radio, Television",Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),"Film, Radio & Television",KI1QA,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000511121500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Korean foreign assistance levels remained quite low throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but have risen significantly in the last seven years, and the paper asks why this is so. Historically, strong support for aid has been linked primarily to humanitarian motives; the countries which have emphasized such motives have maintained much stronger aid programmes. The paper argues that Korea did not emphasize these rationales for aid very strongly, and that this, together with the weak development of Korean civil society, resulted in low levels of support for aid and low aid levels through the 1990s. However, a recent rise in voluntarism, the expanded political influence of NGOs, and strong popular support for assistance to the poor, both at home and abroad, signal a shift in civic values, and can account for the current increase in humanitarian aid to North Korea and the developing world. Korean foreign assistance policy, then, shows great promise, and has the potential to serve as a model for newly developed countries, while providing Korea with lasting prestige.","Oxford Ctr Mission Studies, Oxford OX2 6HB, England; Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Coll Polit Sci & Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lumsdaine, D (corresponding author), Oxford Ctr Mission Studies, POB 70, Oxford OX2 6HB, England.",dlumsdaine@ocms.ac.uk; jcschopf@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,38,26,28,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0951-2748,,,PAC REV,Pac.

The group was founded in 1981 by Cho Hee-Seung in the biblical tradition, with references to Korean spiritual traditions as well. Its most salient feature is the self-consecration of Cho Hee-Seung as Victor Christ and God, the unique universal Messiah. In order to show the correlation between this spiritual movement, Protestantism, and Korean culture, I survey the recent history of South Korea and its staunch nationalism largely spurred by Protestant missionaries at the turn of the 20th century. I then present the core teachings of Cho the Messiah: the biological immortality of neohumans, the Hebrew genealogy of the Koreans thanks to the saga of the Lost Tribe of Dan from Israel to Korea, and his major vows to protect South Korea. An assessment of the heritage of Protestantism in this movement is then offered through the perspective of post-colonialism since Victory Altar sees itself and its Messiah/God as far superior to the God and Messiah of the Western powers that brought Christianity to Korea without really understanding it.","[Rigal-Cellard, Bernadette] Univ Bordeaux Montaigne, Dept North Amer Studies & Religious Studies, F-33607 Pessac, France",,"Rigal-Cellard, B (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux Montaigne, Dept North Amer Studies & Religious Studies, F-33607 Pessac, France.",brcellard@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,DEC,2024,15,12,,,,,,,1438,10.3390/rel15121438,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel15121438,,,15,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,Q4P5N,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001384521700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article analyzes Kim Jong-il's military-first politics as a strategic choice for regime survival, in which the locus of political power switched from the party to the military. At the same time, Kim Jong-il formulated a complex system of circumventing the possibility of the armed forces' political domination, including personalistic control using sticks and carrots, fortifying security and surveillance institutions, and compartmentalizing the security institutions for intra- and inter-organizational checks and balances to prevent the emergence of organized opposition to the regime. Although an effective short-term solution, military-first politics could never be a long-term strategy for building gangseongdaeguk (a powerful and prosperous nation). The current Kim Jong-un regime needs to conduct sweeping reforms to address dire economic difficulties, which might result in a departure from his father's legacy and downgrade the military's power. In this process, the current regime's (in)stability will depend on how it maintains a balance between revoking military-first politics and preserving the armed forces' allegiance.

In the highly gendered and racialized Korean English language market, however, they must prove their native English speaker status. Remaining oriented towards the U.S. as their proper home, they also continually defer leaving South Korea as it means giving up the privileges of being a male English speaker and become stuck in a life of leisure and aimlessness. As the shadow of neoliberal globalization deepens and their linguistic capital becomes devalued with the return of more Koreans from abroad, their feelings of being stuck turn into global fatigue.","Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Cho, J (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 607 Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",songcho@illinois.edu,,,,,,,40,45,58,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-6441,1467-9841,,J SOCIOLING,J.

Popular content on YouTube channels was examined to determine South Koreans' perceptions of North Korea and North Korean defectors. We also interviewed YNKD YouTubers and classified the types of practices in response to such perceptions. The results indicated that South Korean subscribers prefer content highlighting South Korea's superiority over North Korea. In response, YNKD YouTubers have produced content that may be characterized as cultural assimilation, conflict and compromise and seeking alternatives. This study found that the decisive factor that distinguishes these three response types is the pursuit of public interest, i.e., aiming to change South Koreans' perception of North Korean defectors. Inner conflicts over financial benefits limit YNKDs' practice and impede their move towards solidarity-based collective action. The findings suggest that YNKD YouTubers who want to change mainstream society's perceptions can contribute to unification by producing authentic and creative content about North Korea.","[Son, Myung-Ah] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, You-Yeon] Korean Educ Dev Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, You-Yeon] Korean Educ Dev Inst, 7 Gyohak Ro, Jincheon 27873, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, YY (corresponding author), Korean Educ Dev Inst, 7 Gyohak Ro, Jincheon 27873, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea.",youyeon.kim@gmail.com,"Kim, You-Yeon/JEP-2053-2023; Kim, Youyeon/F-4081-2015","Kim, Youyeon/0000-0003-4508-1353; Son, Myung-Ah/0009-0009-9307-0334",Department of Sociology at Seoul National University,Department of Sociology at Seoul National University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Department of Sociology at Seoul National University.",,36,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0117-1968,2057-049X,,ASIAN PAC MIGR J,Asian Pac.

Normatively speaking, for peaceful reunification it would be desirable for the fate of the WPK to be left to the people and free democratic elections, like in Germany; however, the particular trajectories of Korean contemporary history, including the Korean War (1950-1953), loom over such a worthwhile procedure.

The data were derived from the First Korean Working Conditions Survey conducted in 2006 with a representative sample of the Korean working population (n = 10,039). The overall prevalence of WRSP was 5.1 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 4.7-5.5). Those who experienced sexual harassment at work (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.47: 95 % CI 1.77-6.81), discrimination due to sex (aOR 2.44: 95 % CI 1.36-4.36) or age (aOR 2.22: 95 % CI 1.52-3.23), violence at work (aOR 1.98: 95 % CI 1.06-3.68), threat of violence (aOR 1.96: 95 % CI 1.05-3.66), poor work-life balance (aOR 1.78: 95 % CI 1.44-2.20), low job satisfaction (aOR 1.69: 95 % CI 1.37-2.09), high cognitive (OR 1.64: 95 % CI 1.32-2.03) and emotional (aOR 1.53: 95 % CI 1.22-1.91) demands, job insecurity (aOR 1.32: 95 % CI 1.07-1.63), and high work intensity (aOR 1.55: 95 % CI: 95 % CI 1.25-1.92) had an increased risk of WRSP compared to their respective counterparts (p < 0.01). Low social support was not significantly associated with WRSP (aOR 0.88: 95 % CI 0.67-1.15). The results revealed that poor psychosocial working conditions may be related to a high prevalence of WRSP among representative Korean workers.","[Park, Jae Bum] Ajou Univ, Sch Med, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Park, Jae Bum; Nakata, Akinori; Swanson, Naomi G.] NIOSH, Div Appl Res & Technol, Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Cincinnati, OH 45226 USA; [Chun, Heekyoung] NIOSH, Educ & Informat Div, Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Cincinnati, OH 45226 USA",Ajou University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH); Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH),"Nakata, A (corresponding author), NIOSH, Div Appl Res & Technol, Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, 4676 Columbia Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45226 USA.",nakataa-tky@umin.ac.jp,"Nakata, Akinori/A-2399-2008","Chun, HeeKyoung/0000-0002-1031-6514; Nakata, Akinori/0000-0003-3008-4615",,,,,83,41,46,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-0131,1432-1246,,INT ARCH OCC ENV HEA,Int.

The recent increase in sport exchanges between the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the north offer a unique opportunity to analyse the changing role and efficacy of contemporary sport diplomacy. The research investigates and critically evaluates the political agenda of these events on the divided peninsula. The theoretical framework of this study derives from the pluralist paradigm of International Relations. Therefore this article does not only deal with state initiatives and governmental policies but also with non-state and non-governmental organizations. The article focuses on sport's contribution to the improvement of inter-Korean relations and the reunification of the Korean nation, a key policy objective of both countries, in one of the very few remaining politically divided societies. Due to sport's versatile symbolic potency sport diplomacy goes far beyond the promotion of detente between the two Korean states and makes a significant contribution to the foreign policy agenda.","Univ Brighton, Sch Serv Management, Eastbourne BN20 7UR, England",University of Brighton,"Merkel, U (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Serv Management, Darley Rd, Eastbourne BN20 7UR, England.",u.merkel@brighton.ac.uk,,"Merkel, Udo/0000-0002-4693-7013",,,,,54,58,60,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1012-6902,,,INT REV SOCIOL SPORT,Int.

The major research question is whether companies that are listed in an emerging market have a disadvantage as they are underpriced through a higher COC (as compared with companies that are traded in developed markets). Consistent with the Korea Discount, we find that the COC is significantly higher for Korean companies than for companies in other countries after controlling for other relevant factors.

While male-centered literary Chinese learning held highest prestige, the patriarchal families of the time cherished their private archives, in which vernacular letters were sentimental mementos, testaments of women's learning, and status symbols. This familial epistolary archive received varying elaborations as it transitioned into museums and departments of national literature in South Korea. While elite vernacular epistolary style (naeganch'e) embodies the core of tradition and national literature for such colonial-era intellectuals as Yi Pyonggi (1891-1968) and Yi T'aejun (1904-?), the anticolonial and antifeudal current of the post-1945 South Korean scholarship overlooks the elite tradition. This explains the persistent invisibility of women-centered elite vernacular culture in the contemporary scholarship of Choson Korea. Developing the notion of itinerary-the transition, appropriation, and recoding of elite vernacular letters-this article ponders the implication of archival practices upon the study of the past, and highlights the knowledge systems that determined the visibility and meaning of elite vernacular culture in Korea's modern era.","[Chizhova, Ksenia] Princeton Univ, East Asian Studies Dept, Korean Literature & Cultural Studies, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Chizhova, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, East Asian Studies Dept, Korean Literature & Cultural Studies, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,7,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0731-1613,2158-1665,,J KOREAN STUD,J.

I build on the relationship between heritage, collective memory and national identity, and argue that the division that typifies South Korean society has implications that extend beyond socio-political issues. Anchored within a broader discursive context, the museum became an important memory carrier involved in the process of debating the issue of national identity. Although no agreement has been reached regarding the proper historical narrative the site should exhibit, the museum has nevertheless offered an opportunity to shape a form of national identity that can embrace a more complex perspective on the country's contemporary history. At present, though, this contentious site has demonstrated the extent to which the legacy of the conservative-progressive divide remains deep. I offer a discursive context that is useful for the study of current debates over heritage sites in South Korea, while the overall analysis illuminates the idea that the present-centred management of heritage in national museums can, potentially, play a part in the process of forming more intricate notions of national identity.","[Podoler, Guy] Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, Korean Studies, Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Podoler, G (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, Korean Studies, Haifa, Israel.",gpodoler@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,76,7,8,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

This study compared trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates among Koreans in South Korea and Korean Americans and non-Hispanic whites in California between 1999 and 2009, and examined CRC screening rates and socio-demographic correlates of CRC screening in the two Korean populations. Design. Age-standardized CRC incidence and mortality rates of Koreans in South Korea and Korean Americans and non-Hispanic whites in California for the years 1999-2009 were obtained from annual reports of cancer statistics and modeled using joinpoint regression. Using 2009 data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the California Health Interview Survey, we estimated and compared CRC screening rates and test modalities. We used multiple logistic regression to examine socio-demographic correlates of completion of CRC screening according to the guidelines among the two Korean populations. Results. CRC incidence and mortality rates among South Koreans increased during 1999-2009 but more slowly during the late 2000s. In California, CRC incidence increased among Korean American females but decreased among non-Hispanic whites. About 37% of South Koreans and 60% of Korean Americans reported completion of CRC screening according to guidelines in 2009. Among South Koreans, married status, higher income, and private health insurance were associated with CRC screening, adjusting for other factors. Among Korean Americans, having health insurance was associated with CRC screening. Conclusion. Despite almost identical CRC screening guidelines in South Korea and the USA and substantially higher screening rates among Korean Americans as compared to South Koreans, disparities remain in both populations with respect to CRC statistics. Thus, efforts to promote primary and secondary prevention of CRC in both Korean populations are critically important in both countries.","[Ryu, So Yeon] Chosun Univ, Sch Med, Kwangju, South Korea; [Crespi, Catherine M.; Maxwell, Annette E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Crespi, Catherine M.; Maxwell, Annette E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",Chosun University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center,"Maxwell, AE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amaxwell@ucla.edu,,"Crespi, Catherine/0000-0002-6150-2181; Maxwell, Annette/0000-0002-2334-8582",NIH/NCI [P30 CA016042]; NIH/NCRR [UL1 TR000124]; UCLA Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network [U48DP001934]; Charles Drew University/UCLA Cancer Center [NIH U54 CA143931]; UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity; National Cancer Institute [P30CA016042] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,NIH/NCI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIH/NCRR(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); UCLA Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network; Charles Drew University/UCLA Cancer Center; UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity; National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"C.M.C. was supported by NIH/NCI grant P30 CA016042 and NIH/NCRR UL1 TR000124.

This article aims to explain Pyongyang's foreign behavior between 1995 and 2011 with a concept called the balance of dependence. Although it stood on the brink of collapse in the 1990s, the North Korean regime defied the odds and survived with the help of neighboring countries, namely South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States. This article intends to explain Pyongyang's foreign policy under Kim Jong Il by focusing on how it deliberately built a portfolio of dependence on its neighbors. I argue that North Korea's foreign behavior had been attuned to the rise and fall of assistance from other nations. It sought to disperse its dependence among a host of potential sponsors in order not to be exclusively reliant on a single donor state, fearing restrictions on its political autonomy. As long as its neighbors are willing to help out, Pyongyang will continue to play one sponsor off the others while making progress with its nuclear and missile programs.","[Woo, Seongji] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Woo, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea.",sjwoo@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,4,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Western traditional and popular music had a significant impact on the development of Korean popular music beginning as early as the Japanese occupation. This paper has examined the origin, formation, specific forms, and meaning of jazz song, a representative genre of early popular music through considering the formation of Korean popular music and the ways in which Western music played a role in its development. This subject is discussed in detail referencing examples of adapted and original songs. Just as in the present, Korea was influenced by popular culture from all over the world, wherein the influence of foreign music is attested by the emergence of jazz song. To demonstrate this point, this paper reviews the specific characteristics of both adapted and original jazz song. Jazz song almost completely disappeared from the surface from the 1940s on, as Japan entered into a state of war and banned Western music from the U.S. and England considering it as music of the enemies. Consequently, much Western-influenced music, including jazz and jazz song, disappeared from the popular music scene. After Korea was liberated from Japan, Korean popular music was newly reorganized under the absolute influence of Western popular music. The music resulted from this reorganization has been settled as the mainstream popular music today and is being re-exported into the world boosted by the Korean-wave. In this light, jazz song from the first half of the twentieth century is meaningful in that it were the matrix of such music.","[Chang, Yu-jeong] Dankook Univ Korea, Ctr Gen Educ, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Chang, YJ (corresponding author), Dankook Univ Korea, Ctr Gen Educ, Yongin, South Korea.",jaayou@dankook.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033317],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033317).,,23,2,3,0,10,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2016,47,3,,,,,651,673,,,,,,23,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,DY2XP,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000384955700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, by analyzing columns and editorials of three Korean newspapers, Choson ilbo, Tonga ilbo, and Kyonghyang sinmun, this study reveals that, following the division of Korea (1948), Korean nationalism trifurcated, at least in South Korea, into three different but closely related versions, each of which did not deny that historically all Koreans belonged to the same nation, but defined we, the people of Korea differently: (1) tanil minjok (one nation) nationalism, which included not only South Koreans but also North Korean compatriots in we, the people of Korea; (2) anticommunist nationalism, which included South Koreans and patriotic compatriots of North Korea in we, the people of Korea while excluding North Korean commies; and (3) Taehan Min'guk (the great ROK) nationalism, which identified only South Koreans as we, the people of Korea. In doing so, this study suggests that, as the division of Korea solidified after the Korean War, South Koreans began to imagine themselves as a different national community, separated from North Korean compatriots.","[Kim, Bumsoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Liberal Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Bumsoo] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kim, B (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Liberal Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,SBS Culture Foundation,SBS Culture Foundation,"I would like to thank Prof. Yong-Chool Ha and Prof. Clark W.

After the decision was made to acquire nuclear weapons capability, Pyongyang decided to use the process of nuclear crisis diplomacy that unfolded in the early 1990s in ways that would allow it to weather any repercussions and counter any efforts of coercion. Pyongyang did not, it seems, negotiate in good faith toward realizing a goal of actual denuclearization. In the paper, a historical analogy is used to demonstrate the broader strategic logic. At the turn of the twentieth century, imperial Germany embarked on a plan to build a major navy. In order to prevent preemption to be triggered by such a radical program, its leadership developed the so-called Tirpitz Plan, which German foreign policy wanted to become the instrument of this armament program and prevent preemption. By using the Tirpitz Plan as a matrix for analysis of North Korea's nuclear diplomacy, new light is shed on nearly two decades of denuclearization efforts. Pyongyang's strategic thinking about nuclear weapons and its instrumentalization of diplomacy come into clear focus. The findings open up new questions for ongoing or future efforts to prevent further nuclear proliferation as well.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Maass, M (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",mmaass@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,8,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

In contrast with the Cuban case, US-North Korea relations are only getting worse due to the North Korean nuclear program. The United States adopted new legislation for strong economic sanctions against North Korea after the country's fourth nuclear test was carried out on 6 January 2016 and its launching of a long-range missile on 6 February 2016. This study aims to find an answer as to why Cuba and North Korea are walking different paths in their relationships with the United States even though they have been subject to similar sanctions from the US. Recent analysis shows that factors in security, international and economic surroundings, geostrategic factors and domestic politics contribute to notable divergence between Cuba and North Korea in regards to their relationships with the United States.","[Lee, Wootae] Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Wootae; Park, Seong-yong] Inha Univ, Ctr Int Studies, Inchon, South Korea",Inha University,"Lee, W (corresponding author), Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Seoul, South Korea.",leewt@kinu.or.kr; royal_irish@hotmail.com,"Park, Seong Yong/IZQ-1385-2023",,,,,,46,2,2,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

J,"Merkel, U",,,,"Merkel, Udo",,,North Korean Media Accounts of the Olympic and Asian Games: The Fatherland's Friends and Foes,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korea; media accounts; Korean Central News Agency (KCNA); Olympic Games; Asian Games,POLITICS,"Prior to the 1988 Seoul Olympics, ideological tensions and conflicts frequently overshadowed international sports events as, for example, both South Korea (ROK) and North Korea (DPRK) tried to exploit these occasions to prove the superiority of their political systems and beliefs. South Korea was originally awarded the right to host the 6th Asian Games in 1970. However, for a number of reasons, including security threats from North Korea, the Games were moved to Thailand. Eventually, the DPRK did not participate in this event. Nor did the DPRK attend the 1988 Summer Olympics hosted by South Korea. This has changed considerably over the last two decades. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, both Koreas use the Olympic and Asian Games as a global stage to celebrate national unity, keep the reunification issue in the public domain and treat each other with respect, dignity and appreciation. Their joint appearances as one team marching behind the reunification flag held by one athlete from the North and one from the South have become impressive examples of the power of sport to symbolically unite divided nations and to promote a reconciliatory spirit albeit only temporarily. The context of the Olympic and Asian Games has also provided both countries with frequent opportunities to pursue foreign policy objectives, to engage in a political dialogue and to build bridges. This paper focuses on North Korean media accounts that deal with the complex relationship with its South Korean compatriots in the context of both the Olympic and Asian Games. Furthermore, it touches on the DPRK's relationship with its archenemy Japan. The paper draws extensively on publications by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency, as well as other official sources, in order to develop an empathetic understanding of public discourses in one of the least understood and enigmatic countries in the world.","Univ Brighton, Sch Sport & Serv Management, Eastbourne, E Sussex, England",University of Brighton,"Merkel, U (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Sport & Serv Management, Eastbourne, E Sussex, England.",u.merkel@brighton.ac.uk,,"Merkel, Udo/0000-0002-4693-7013",,,,,15,3,3,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0952-3367,,,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

Since July 2004, the Chinese government has used this top-down approach to cultural diplomacy as a symbolic tool for advancing Chinese cinema and opening the domestic market to a host of willing international partners. Korean filmmakers in particular have exploited the (often informal) opportunities presented, engaging in vigorous cooperation with Chinese colleagues across all sectors of the production ecosystem. The continuing flow of Chinese-Korean transnational film encounters, underpinned by influential personal networks, resulted in the signing of a formal China-Korea co-production agreement in July 2014. To examine the efficacy of this policy intervention, this article analyzes the diversity of film collaboration that preceded this agreement and its impact on transnational filmmaking in China. It investigates the strategies used in the remaking of Korean auteur Lee Man Hee's 1966 melodrama Late Autumn (2010), technical innovation in the VFX-heavy Mr. Go (2013), and the making of mega-distributor CJ E&M's romance drama A Wedding Invitation (2013) to illustrate how Korean firms and practitioners are expanding the commercial entertainment boundaries of Chinese cinema. In so doing, it also reveals how Chinese film companies are enabling the Korean film industry to internationalize its approach to overseas markets beyond the kind of conspicuous policy initiatives tailored for a globalized cultural economy.","[Yecies, Brian] Univ Wollongong, Sch Humanities & Social Inquiry, Fac Law Humanities & Arts, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Yecies, B (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Humanities & Social Inquiry, Fac Law Humanities & Arts, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",byecies@uow.edu.au,"Yecies, Brian/P-4928-2016","Yecies, Brian/0000-0001-9296-6651",Australian Research Council [DP140101643],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [grant number DP140101643].,,21,37,37,0,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

During the early years of colonial rule the Government General of Korea did not actively limit the entry of Chinese laborers and the colonial state was in fact one of their largest employers. However, in the 1930s migration restrictions appeared not only in Korea but also in neighboring Manchuria. Therefore, the efforts at border control in colonial Korea need to be viewed in conjunction with labor policies in Japan and Manchuria. The restrictions on Chinese labor were ultimately linked to efforts to reconfigure Japan's new territorial possessions after the Manchurian Incident in 1931 as the region became a space for resolving the intractable social and economic problems of the Japanese empire.","[Kim, Michael] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",mkim@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Michael/U-4796-2018",,,,,,56,3,3,0,5,"ACAD EAST ASIAN STUD, SUNGKYUNKWAN UNIVERSITY",JONGNO-GU,"53 MYEONGNYUN-DONG 3-GA, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL 110-745, SOUTH KOREA",1598-2661,,,SUNGKYUN J EAST ASIA,Sungkyun J.

Why was this series of negotiations successful at first, followed by a stalemate, and then collapsed after two decades? There are many studies that focus on the behavior of North Korea, China, and the United States from a power perspective. This paper argues that a high degree of cooperation at the bilateral level among the majority of participants is a determining factor for the success of the talks. Strong reciprocal engagements, which are called thick reinforcements, resulted in solid unity among participating states and decisive collective action. The research finds different effects caused by combinations of thick reinforcement and weak engagement across dyads. While a strong contagion effect contributed to the success of the talks, the occurrence of hedging generated offsetting and neutralization effects, which stagnated the discussions. This paper develops a new metric to measure the various combinations of bilateral relations among China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, and the United States. The paper finds that in addition to non-proliferation, bilateral engagement and unity are vital for resolving nuclear crises.","[Golobokov, Andrei] Univ Canada West, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Golobokov, Andrei] Univ British Columbia, Corpus Christi Coll, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Golobokov, A (corresponding author), Univ Canada West, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Golobokov, A (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Corpus Christi Coll, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",andreygolobokov@gmail.ru,"; Golobokov, Andrei/AAN-6805-2020","Golobokov, Andrei/0000-0002-0813-9301;",,,,,64,0,0,0,10,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Drawing on 45 in-depth interviews with North Korean refugees, interviews with regular visitors to North Korea and NGO workers, and our own field notes from trips to North Korea, we analyse changes over three discernible (yet overlapping) economic periods: the 1960s-90s pre-famine period; the mid-1990s to late 2000s grassroots capitalism era; and the current Kim Jong Un period of quasi-capitalism. As dress is a discursive daily practice of gender, we focus on the practice of femininity as shown through North Korean women's fashion choices. We argue that images of women in state propaganda have been shaped primarily by male leaders, but norms of femininity have shaped, and also been shaped by, women themselves. That is, the recent trend for North Korean women to dress in hyper-feminine styles can be explained in terms of women remaking themselves and planning their future lives.","[Dalton, Bronwen] Univ Technol Sydney, Not For Profit & Social Enterprise Program, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jung, Kyungja; Willis, Jacqueline] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Jung, K (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Kyungja.Jung@uts.edu.au,"; Willis, Jacqueline/MVU-6377-2025","Dalton, Bronwen/0000-0002-9507-1447; Jung, Kyungja/0000-0002-9346-7712; Willis, Jacqueline/0000-0002-3152-8479",Australian Research Council [DP130101700],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council under Grant DP130101700.,,48,5,5,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

The Association of Korean Medicine (AKOM) established the COVID-19 telemedicine center of Korean medicine (KM telemedicine center) in Daegu and Seoul. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the results of the KM telemedicine center and the clinical possibility of using herbal medicines for COVID-19. Methods: All procedures were conducted by voice call following standardized guidelines. The students in the reception group obtained informed consent from participants and they collected basic information. Subsequently, Korean Medicine doctors assessed COVID-19-related symptoms and prescribed the appropriate herbal medicine according to the KM telemedicine guidelines. The data of patients who completed the program by June 30, 2020, were analyzed. Results: From March 9 to June 30, 2020, 2324 patients participated in and completed the KM telemedicine program. Kyung-Ok-Ko (n=2285) was the most prescribed herbal medicine, and Qingfei Paidu decoction (I and II, n=2053) was the second most prescribed.

This article will further show that the enduring nuclear-weapons problem in North Korea has been inextricably linked to human rights issues there, specifically because Washington wants to change the behavior of officials in Pyongyang so that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) becomes a state that at least remotely resembles a liberal democracy. Although supported by much of the international community, including the United States' South Korean and Japanese allies in Northeast Asia, Washington's North Korean policy has remained ineffective, as Pyongyang has continued to perform missile testing and still possesses nuclear weapons.","[Difilippo, Anthony] Lincoln Univ, Dept Sociol, Lincoln Univ, PA 19352 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Lincoln University - Pennsylvania,"Difilippo, A (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Sociol, Lincoln Univ, PA 19352 USA.",,,,,,,,100,1,1,1,9,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",0967-067X,1873-6920,,COMMUNIS POST-COMMUN,Communist Post-Communist Stud.,JUN,2020,53,2,,,,,153,176,,10.1525/j.postcomstud.2020.53.2.xx,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/j.postcomstud.2020.53.2.xx,,,24,International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations; Government & Law,OH8LN,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000582843400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus far, little attention has been given to the effect of acculturation on the mental health of coethnic migrants in non-traditional immigration states such as South Korea. Using 2010 survey data on 1,200 North Korean refugees, this study examines the effect of preserving cultural norms and practices from the home country on the mental health of North Koreans in the South. Based on an acculturation typology, we categorize respondents into four groups based on their attitudes toward home and host cultures. Given South Korea's homogenous context, our cluster analyses extracted two acculturation types-the integrated and the assimilated groups. The finding that integrated or bicultural individuals had better mental health status than assimilated individuals underscores the crucial role of the culture of origin in attenuating acculturative distress for coethnic migrants in South Korea.","[Shin, Hwajin; Yoon, In-Jin] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Yoon, IJ (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Sociol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",yoonin@korea.ac.kr,,"Shin, Hwajin/0000-0003-3987-5528","Social Science Korea Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2016S1A3A2924944, NRF-2015H1A2A1034022]; Global PhD Fellowship Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - the Ministry of Education [NRF-2016S1A3A2924944, NRF-2015H1A2A1034022]",Social Science Korea Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Global PhD Fellowship Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - the Ministry of Education,This research was supported by the Social Science Korea Program and Global PhD Fellowship Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2016S1A3A2924944; NRF-2015H1A2A1034022).,,51,5,8,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0117-1968,2057-049X,,ASIAN PAC MIGR J,Asian Pac.

This article captures the moment when vernacular Korean scriptural practices ascended the elite canon; which resulted in the emergence of high vernacular culture. It historicizes the gendered logic of representation in a male-authored historical archive to uncover the contours of a women-centered vernacular aesthetic canon that assumed a status of prestige, alongside male culture in literary Chinese. The article unravels the meaning of the term calligraphy when it is applied to women's Vernacular handwriting and ponders the connection between women:5 bodily discipline, productive work, and exquisite vernacular brushwork. This opens an alternative perspective not only on the gender politics of the Choson society but also on the culture of the time, which is hitherto seen as dominated by a male-centered literary Chinese canon.","[Chizhova, Ksenia] Princeton Univ, East Asian Studies Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Chizhova, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, East Asian Studies Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",kchizhova@princeton.edu,,,Korea Foundation; Academy of Korean Studies graduate fellowship; Australian National University's postdoctoral fellowship,Korea Foundation; Academy of Korean Studies graduate fellowship; Australian National University's postdoctoral fellowship,"I am deeply grateful to Dorothy Ko and Jungwon Kim, who read multiple drafts of this manuscript and suggested a number of crucial improvements.

Nevertheless, considering the lessons learned from past denuclearization negotiations, and Pyongyang's nuclear capacity and will for nuclear development, a solely optimistic outlook is not advisable. In order to pursue successful denuclearization negotiations, a precise understanding of new negotiation conditions, particularly each party's negotiation strategy and leverage, and application of them is very important. Also, a substantive negotiation strategy and roadmap for the denuclearization should be prepared to be able to pressure and reach an agreement with North Korea. Taking account of the negotiation leverage of North Korea and the United States, a one-sided negotiation with North Korea surrendering to the United States is not likely.

A sample of 6,399 women aged 35-64 years was included. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D-10 scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression), in pre- and post-menopausal women. Results indicated that being single, having poorer self-rated health, and having a lower economic background were associated with an increased risk of depression in both groups. Being unemployed also increased the risk of depressed mood in pre-menopausal women, while factors significantly associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms in post-menopausal women included having a lower level of education, musculoskeletal pain, and having pain or discomfort. Thus, these factors should be considered when developing interventions to improve the mood and quality of life of middle-aged women. Interventions in the local community may include health services (hormone therapy), educational learning programs, counselling, and improved access to leisure activities.","[Eo, Yong-Sook] Dongguk Univ, Dept Nursing, 123 Dongdae Ro, Gyeongju Si 38066, Gyeongsangbu Do, South Korea",Dongguk University,"Eo, YS (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Dept Nursing, 123 Dongdae Ro, Gyeongju Si 38066, Gyeongsangbu Do, South Korea.",nursingeo@dongguk.ac.kr,,,,,,,47,6,6,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0895-2841,1540-7322,,J WOMEN AGING,J.

However, even when it has been 70 years since the outbreak of the Korean War, the two Koreas that used to be one nation are still in conflict. There have been many discourses on unification over the past 70 years, but these discourses still fail to create clear rules and a framework for unification. Discourses from the perspective of biblical theology offer insight regarding the problems at stake as well as alternatives, but they do not offer perspectives on a definite solution. This article, in line with its statement on biblical theology, does not pretend to contribute to a clear-cut solution to meet the challenge of Korea's unification. Rather, this article intends to contribute to the formation of an emotional consensus that can contribute to the unification of Korea by looking at the teachings about peace in the Gospel of Matthew. The article explores whether the notion of embracement, forgiveness and love written during the conflict between the Matthean community and Formative Judaism can be applied to help create an emotional bond between the two Koreas. The terms embracement, forgiveness and love found in the Gospel of Matthew are upheld as symbolising peace derived from opposition and conflict. Jesus taught us to overcome situations of opposition and conflict through embracement, forgiveness and love. Contribution: The purpose and contribution of this article was to discuss if the notions of embracement, forgiveness and love found in the Gospel of Matthew can be helpful for the emotional preparation of the peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula by comparing the situations reflected in the Gospel of Matthew and that of the Korean Peninsula.","[Shin, In-Cheol] Korea Baptist Theol Univ & Seminary, Daejeon, South Korea; [Shin, In-Cheol] Univ Pretoria, Fac Theol & Relig, Dept New Testament Studies, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Shin, IC (corresponding author), Korea Baptist Theol Univ & Seminary, Daejeon, South Korea.;Shin, IC (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Fac Theol & Relig, Dept New Testament Studies, Pretoria, South Africa.",incheolshin@kbtus.ac.kr,,"Shin, In Cheol/0000-0003-0983-1495",,,,,62,1,1,0,1,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0259-9422,2072-8050,,HTS TEOL STUD-THEOL,HTS Teol.

Approximately one-third of Korean older adults experience depressive symptoms, and Korea has the highest elder suicide rate among 34 developed nations. Mental health literacy is an important component of promoting mental health, yet studies on the concept have been conducted in few countries. Aim This study examines the level of mental health literacy among Korean older adults and identifies factors associated with their mental health literacy. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 596 community-dwelling Korean adults aged 65 and older. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use framed the study. Results Overall, participants displayed low levels of mental health literacy. They had difficulty recognizing their mental health issues and had limited knowledge about self-help strategies. Mental health literacy was positively associated with education, social support, social network and health status. Discussion and Implications This study highlights a need for efforts to increase mental health literacy among Korean older adults. Strategies that have the potential to empower this population to proactively attend to their mental health include community-based education and national mental health campaigns.","[Kim, Y.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between Korean outpatients' satisfaction with their MDs and their use of traditional Korean medicine (KM). Methods: Data were drawn from the 2011 annual Korea Health Panel, a national representative sample. We analyzed the relationship between outpatients' use of KM and outpatients' satisfaction with MDs by using the responses of 9,753 outpatients, including 1,946 KM outpatients. The Andersen behavior model was applied to select the variables. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were tested by Factor Analysis and Cronbach's alpha. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate five MD satisfaction indicators (patient's trust in MD, MD's careful listening, MD's sufficient explanation, MD's consultation time, and MD's respect for patient) and the overall satisfaction with the MD. Results: There was no significant difference between the MD satisfaction of KM users and that of nonusers in any of the 5 indicators of MD satisfaction. When we controlled for all independent variables from the Anderson behavior model, however, the patients' overall dissatisfaction with MDs was associated with their use of KM (OR = 0.87,0.76-0.99). In addition, the more a patient was dissatisfied with the consultation time of their MD, the more they used KM (OR = 0.82, 072-0.94). Conclusions: Patients who were dissatisfied with their MD were more likely to use KM; the main indicator affecting MD dissatisfaction was the relatively short time of MD consultations.

The study considers how large volumes of refugees would affect South Korea and other neighboring countries. It also proposes likely countermeasures for South Korea and its allies. If sudden regime change in North Korea were to lead to large-scale refugees entering China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea; it could bring massive changes in the balance of power in Northeast Asia. A refugee crisis of this magnitude demands meticulous planning to minimize unexpected consequences to the region. This paper examines the following questions: What is the decision-making process that refugees undergo when deciding to leave North Korea? What would be the volume of North Korean refugees heading into China, Russia, and Japan? What would be the volume of refugees entering South Korea? What would be the most likely routes taken by refugees? This study analyzes these questions and suggests policy implications for the South Korean government.","[Kwan-soo, Han] Chosun Univ, Dept Mil Arts & Sci, Gwangju, South Korea",Chosun University,"Kwan-soo, H (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, Dept Mil Arts & Sci, Gwangju, South Korea.",hks0101@paran.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Targeting South Korean adolescents' ambivalence toward unification and North Korean refugees is a talk show called Great Friends. Moderated by a South Korean host, Great Friends presents the experiences of a group of North Korean and South Korean youth. Given the current social climate surrounding North Korean refugees in South Korea, this study investigates how North Korean youth on this program are discursively constructed over the course of 17 episodes aired in 2015. Considering the unequal power relations between the host country and refugees, this study applies critical discourse analysis (CDA) to interpret how North Korean adolescents are presented to a South Korean audience. The analysis reveals the 'othering' of North Koreans through discourses of difference. Despite presenting North Koreans as friends to South Koreans, these discursive constructions create a dichotomy by positioning North Koreans as inferior to their southern counterparts. The findings contribute to rethinking how authorities promote the integration of North Koreans in South Korea.","[Lee, Kathy; Choi, Sunyoung; Min, Jee Won] Korea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",leekats@korea.ac.kr; ssun0910@korea.ac.kr; bingasuki@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,47,4,4,0,19,DE GRUYTER MOUTON,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, 10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1860-7330,1860-7349,,TEXT TALK,Text Talk,NOV,2019,39,6,,,,,725,745,,10.1515/text-2019-0236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/text-2019-0236,,,21,Communication; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Communication; Linguistics,JK6HY,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000494943900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The serious nature of the South Korean currency meltdown in 1997 resulted at first glance in a striking transition in the South Korean political economy from state-driven market and industrial policies, and a strong nationalist policy towards foreign capital (inflow of foreign direct investment), to a neo-liberal policy of globalisation. This article critically examines the paradoxical nature of Korea's globalisation efforts under three political regimes (February 1993-February 2008), as a response to new economic conditions embedded in the nature of developmental capitalism. The paper argues that South Korea's globalisation effort over the period has been highly pragmatic and selective in policy and regulations but has resisted embracing the principles of market-driven globalisation. South Korea's globalisation drive or segyehwa therefore appears only a temporary phenomenon rather than a carefully structured strategic policy.","Univ S Australia, Int Grad Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kim, Wan-soon] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",University of South Australia; Korea University,"Lee, YI (corresponding author), Univ S Australia, Int Grad Sch Business, City W Campus, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",you-il.lee@unisa.edu.au,"Lee, You-il/F-3995-2013","Lee, You-il/0000-0003-2115-9865",,,,,75,11,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Since 2012, the new North Korean leadership has implemented a policy of Byungjin, which implies three major components: cautious market-oriented economic reforms, the development of a full-scale nuclear strike force, and maintenance of very strict surveillance and control systems domestically. It has been argued that the Byungjin policy cannot possibly succeed, but this article demonstrates that, so far, the policy has produced some notable results and delivered a measure of economic growth. This article further argues that the Byungjin policy has the potential of achieving a measure of long-term success, allowing Kim Jong Un and his system to survive for some time, maintaining both political stability and economic growth. It also argues that, given the peculiar international situation of North Korea, and other important variables, including Kim Jong Un's age, the policy makes perfect sense-if judged from the perspective of the North Korean hereditary ruling elite. This article considers the problems Kim Jong Un's model of authoritarian developmentalism will face and focuses on both de-stabilizing and stabilizing factors currently at work in North Korea. The article concludes that success of the Byungjin policy is possible, but will lead to a number of new challenges for the outside world.","[Lankov, Andrei] Kookmin Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kookmin University,"Lankov, A (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Lankov, Andrei/AAT-6798-2020",,,,,,53,4,4,0,15,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

As its chairman Hyun raised money and sent it to Kim Won-bong to assist Kim in his struggle against the Japanese forces in China. Also, as a chairman of the Hawaiian branch of the party, Hyun expressed displeasure with a number of decisions made by the government of the United States by writing to news media in Honolulu. He wrote to protest against the American military decision to classify the Korean residents in Hawaii during the Pacific War as enemy aliens. He was not in favor of the American military government established in the southern half of the Korean peninsula after the end of World War II and condemned the indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians in North Korea during the Korean War. Because of the stance he took on these issues and the company he kept, he was mistaken for a radical or a Communist sympathizer.

There are ways to reward North Korean leaders for their willingness to restrict their nuclear and missile programmes. These include partial removal of sanctions, economic assistance and subsidised investment. However, any deal will be costly, since North Korea will exact maximum compensation for its willingness to accept an arms-control regime. Reaching an agreement also will be time consuming.

Anti-Japanism functions as an identification framework in an era when Koreans needed to develop a new discourse which reflects the rapid politico-socio-cultural changes of that period. Under military control of the United States and the Soviet Union, Koreans made Japan the other in a number of ways in order to unite their nation state and national identity, relying specifically on racial difference and hierarchy. First, Korean intellectuals, who once cooperated with colonial Japan in the political sphere or in their ordinary lives, explicitly revealed their anti-Japanese sentiments in their writings right after liberation. Second, after liberation, anti-Japanism emerged from a process that Koreans would exploit, after demarcating the moral difference between themselves and the remaining Japanese migrants, to exclude the Japanese from their community. Finally, anti-Japanism in the post-liberation period can be detected in Koreans' tenacious attitude, as they tacitly restricted the articulation of filial or cultural hybridity with the Japanese people in order to reconfigure their national identity.","[Kang, Jeonggu] Sungkyul Univ, Anyang, South Korea",Sungkyul University,"Kang, JG (corresponding author), Sungkyul Univ, Anyang, South Korea.",kange1@daum.net,,"kang, jeonggu/0000-0003-4141-1423",,,,,57,1,1,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1479-5914,1479-5922,,INT J ASIAN STUD,Int.

They also consider Kim Dae-jung a member of the hegemonic group because he represented the interests of the bourgeoisie and, thus, they contend that the level of inter-Korean reconciliation during his presidency was a product of the hegemonic group's accommodation of the people's nationalist demands. Their arguments are, however, contradictory because, among other things, Kim was one of those most severely damaged by the hegemonic group's ruling ideology. Drawing on Gramsci's concepts, such as historical bloc and hegemonic project, I attempt to resolve the contradiction by arguing that Kim was not a member of the hegemonic group, but a leader of the counter-hegemonic liberal nationalists. Accordingly, this article demonstrates Kim's stance on the chaebol-centred economic structure and his abortive attempt to change it. By the same token, it argues that the inter-Korean reconciliation was a hegemonic project to realise the liberal nationalists' vision of peaceful unification through a liberal approach and to undermine the anti-communism with which the hegemonic group had exercised ideological leadership for decades.","[Choi, Yong Sub] Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea",,"Choi, YS (corresponding author), Univ North Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",willphin@gmail.com,,"Choi, Yong Sub/0000-0001-6527-7519",,,,,80,6,6,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

One of the simplest strategies to defend North Korea's WMD threat is to cope with traditional military deterrence. Most of the military measures to press North Korean regime did not achieve a noticeable success. Hence, it is a time to formulate a novel approach toward North Korea's nuclear issues. South Korea should actively support international nonproliferation regime. It must be emphasized that a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a first premise toward a peaceful unification. A selective engagement, supported by credible conventional and nuclear deterrence, can be another option to deal with North Korean nuclear issue. Compared to these approaches, a cooperative threat reduction approach can provide a safer solution to North Korean nuclear issue. To apply a cooperative threat reduction approach to North Korean case, minimum political-military confidence among North Korea, South Korea, and the United States may be a prerequisite. Once such mutual trust is set in, the next step is formulating an acceptable incentive for North Korea in return for giving up its WMD ambitions.

We performed comparative analyses of textbooks for six secondary schools-three each for the junior middle and senior middle schools-published before and after Kim Jong Un's rule. The comparative analyses adopted Cunningsworth's textbook evaluation framework to examine the textbooks' composition and content: (1) aims and approaches, (2) design and organization, and (3) topic variety. The results showed significant changes in listening materials and activities, among others, as well as concurrent developments in teaching methods. Additionally, each unit significantly reduced the number of topics associated with the idolization of the Kim family and the deliberate vilification of capitalist countries and instead increased the integration of other subjects such as mathematics, science, and technology. This study showed that despite various changes, the aim of English education in North Korea continues to be the maintenance and further development of the socialist system through the improvement of students' English proficiency. This study also discusses the coexistence of different perspectives such as liberal ideas in English textbooks while emphasizing ideology education and its possible ramifications on the future of English education in North Korea.","[Oh, Shinyu; Kim, Tae-Young] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Educ, Dept English Educ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Kim, TY (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Coll Educ, Dept English Educ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",tykim@cau.ac.kr,,"Kim, Tae-Young/0000-0002-2622-3566",,,,,51,1,2,5,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1598-1037,1876-407X,,ASIA PAC EDUC REV,Asia Pac.

For US treaty allies in the region, the challenges to its regional dominance by a rising China have posed dilemmas but also opportunities. No country better exemplifies this contrast than South Korea, which as a middle power finds itself in a precarious position in the regional hierarchy. In recent years, South Korea has responded with new approaches to foreign and security strategies, which are the product of several factors: the challenges wrought by China's growth, US attempts to meet this challenge with a rebalance toward the region, and South Korea's evolving perceptions of national security. My discussion concludes that while external factors have shaped South Korea's security transformation, internal factors have been just as important drivers of South Korea's foreign policy.","[Hwang, Balbina Y.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Hwang, Balbina Y.] US Dept State, Washington, DC 20520 USA; [Hwang, Balbina Y.] Heritage Fdn, Washington, DC 20002 USA",Georgetown University,"Hwang, BY (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Hwang, BY (corresponding author), US Dept State, Washington, DC 20520 USA.;Hwang, BY (corresponding author), Heritage Fdn, Washington, DC 20002 USA.",hwangb@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,31,3,4,1,20,"KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES",SEOUL,"28-42 SAMCHUNG-DONG, CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-230, SOUTH KOREA",0258-9184,,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,JAN-MAR,2017,41,1,,,,,71,97,,10.1353/apr.2017.0004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/apr.2017.0004,,,27,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,EL0WW,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000394343500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herein, we examined the hypothesis that the optimal protein intake of Korean elderly is associated with both improvements in MetS risk as well as favorable changes in body composition. The present study employs a national data source, the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2009), and a total 1,567 elderly (651 men and 916 women) were included in the final data analyses. The incidence of sarcopenia was significantly greater in MetS group than normal group. We observed significantly differences in the amount of protein in the participants' diet that related to sex, income, and education level. The highest protein consumption group had significantly reduced abdominal obesity (44%; 0.293-0.652, P<.001), lower HDL-cholesterol (47%, 0.316-0.683, P<.001), elevated TG (45%, 0.298-0.679, P<.001), and MetS (42%, 0.293-0.598, P<.001) compared to the other groups, after adjustment for sex, income, education level. Total muscle mass were correlated positively with protein consumption, but there was a negative correlation between protein consumption and total fat mass. The present study suggests that at least 0.8 g/kg per day of protein may reduce MetS and help manage body composition changes to mitigate MetS in Korean elderly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines representations of North Korea and unification in South Korean middle school social studies textbooks. South Korea is an interesting case to study, as it is the site of both an intractable conflict and emerging multicultural state. The findings of the study demonstrate that textbooks failed to provide any complex international perspectives of unification; described deficit-only views of North Korea, along with a sense of economic, cultural and political superiority of South Korea; took a lopsided view of the South-North relationship; and offered a nationalistic and ethnocentric approach to legitimising unification. This paper provides recommendations for future research that will resonate with scholars and policymakers in different conflict situations, contributing to diverse understandings of the contextualised nature of textbooks in divided societies.","[Kim, Yeji] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Social Studies Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Social Studies Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",yk2685@tc.columbia.edu,"Kim, Yeji/M-8346-2015","Kim, Yeji/0000-0003-4537-9862",,,,,47,8,8,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,NOV 16,2020,50,8,,,,,1104,1121,,10.1080/03057925.2019.1579636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057925.2019.1579636,,,18,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,OS7CV,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000590318500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

On a personal level, missionaries have to cope with family concerns, maintaining their spiritual life, health problems, financial concerns, frustrations and unfulfilled ideals.

However, as he was directly in charge of implementing Korea's foreign policies from 1899 to 1905, the period of Russo-Japanese confrontation, a full examination of his actions will shed light on Korea's foreign policy at the time. During a period of intense rivalry and confrontation between Japan and Russia, Yi Pomjin remained faithful to King Kojong's diplomatic strategy of either maintaining Korean neutrality or embarking on an alliance with Russia. Leveraging his connections in the royal household department, Yi Pomjin formed his own political network with people from Hamgyong Province and gained political clout through the support of the Min family. In March 1898, Yi, as Korea's minister to the United States, proposed to James Scarth Gale plans for reforming Korea in the fields of politics, education, industry, military, police, civil service, social class system, and dress. Despite serving as Korean minister to the United States at that time, Yi did not advocate American-style reform measures, except for industry. Moreover, although Yi had argued for Korea's alliance with Russia, he attempted to implement a reform plan for Korea that did not rely on one specific country's reform measures but combined the strengths of the reform measures of all major Western powers. Yi, under King Kojong's orders, strove to get a guarantee for Korea's neutrality in case war broke out between Russia and Japan. However, when both Russia and Japan refused to offer such a guarantee, Yi began concentrating his efforts on concluding an alliance treaty with Russia. Yi Pomjin, in other words, was a key player who tried unceasingly to build a close, cooperative alliance between Korea and Russia.","NE Asian Hist Fdn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Young-Soo, K (corresponding author), NE Asian Hist Fdn, Seoul, South Korea.",pasac1@historyfoundation.or.kr,,,,,,,35,2,3,0,6,KYUJANGGAK INST KOREAN STUD,"SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU","NO 103, SAN 56-1, SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0201,,,SEOUL J KOREAN STUD,Seoul J.

Yet, before the Korean Wave hit Japan in the early 2000s, Kusanagi Tsuyoshi, member of popular Japanese boy-band SMAP, had already debuted and gained popularity as Chonangang, his Korean alter-self. From releasing a Korean pop-music single to interviewing South Korean Presidents on Japanese national television, it is undeniable that Kusanagi (and Chonangang) has brought Korea closer to the hearts of the Japanese. In this paper, I argue that Kusanagi's performances of and as Chonangang create a polyglotic, hybrid identity that functions as a third space'' through which notions of an underlying, essential Japanese (and Korean) identity can be destabilised. Beyond mere entertainment, Kusanagi's adoption of an identity position that is neither Japanese nor Korean, yet also both Japanese and Korean, enables the articulation of difference and hybridity which, I contend, has direct relevance to Japan-Korea and Japanese-resident Korean relations.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Japanese Studies, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Min, YS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Japanese Studies, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Block AS4,03-21,9 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",jpsysm@nus.edu.sg,"Yuen, Shu/AAG-8647-2021",,,,,,36,2,2,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

This article utilized a philosophical analysis of literature that is essential to the reinterpretation of this concept. In terms of core concepts, nursing and traditional Korean medicine share common features with each other. On the basis of these common features, cowork in practice should be more developed and articulated.

We argue that it is because any blasphemy against the leader is tantamount to disrespect against the being of the nation and the North Korean people as a whole. This (an extreme form of face saving) can be attributed to the unique identity formation of leader and people in North Korean history and culture where identity is inseparably tied to self-esteem (how we regard ourselves) and esteem (how we are regarded by others). More specifically, our paper will cover four major issues: first, the construction of a cultural theory of North Korea's foreign policy behavior; second, the elucidation of identity, honor, and supreme esteem in the North Korean context through the analysis of its primary documents; third, an empirical examination of deteriorating inter-Korea relations during the Lee Myungbak government, rocket launching, and underground nuclear testing as a way of exploring its theoretical validity, and finally, the paper generates several theoretical, empirical, and policy implications for a better understanding of North Korea's foreign policy behavior.","[Moon, Chung-in] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Moon, CI (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",cimoon@yonsei.ac.kr; shamora@hanmail.net,"Hwang, Ildo/KHW-3462-2024",,,,,,69,6,6,1,19,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SPR,2014,45,1,,,,,1,37,,,,,,37,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,AD5UX,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000333319800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As of the end of 2008, 93 South Korean firms operated in the KIC, with a total of 38,931 North Korean workers along with 1,055 South Korean workers. The project was supposed to be carried out in three stages for years to come; the first stage was well under way and was expected to be completed in 2010. The complex was supposed to employ 100,000 North Korean workers and have 450 tenant companies by the end of 2010. However, such rosy projections about the KIC ended when North Korea cut the reconciliation dialogue with South Korea after its conservative president, Lee Myongbag, took office in February 2008. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a number of key points on the KIC in the context of inter-Korean economic cooperation, along with reasons for the U.S. interest in the KIC. Special note: We completed this paper before North Korea and the United States began to take a series of new hardline actions against each other. However, the basic tone of this paper, an optimistic one, is likely to prevail in the long run because no one wants another Korean war and North Korea is unlikely to collapse any time soon.","[Kim, Suk Hi] Univ Detroit, Coll Business Adm, Detroit, MI 48221 USA; [Lim, Eul-Chul] Kyungnam Univ, Inst Far Eastern Studies, Seoul, South Korea",University of Detroit Mercy; Kyungnam University,"Kim, SH (corresponding author), Univ Detroit, Coll Business Adm, 4001 W McNichols Rd, Detroit, MI 48221 USA.",ink@udmercy.edu; eulclim@hanmail.net,,,,,,,12,4,4,0,15,"MCFARLAND & COMPANY, INC, PUBLISHERS",JEFFERSON,"BOX 611, JEFFERSON, NC 28640 USA",1551-2789,1841-2886,,N KOREAN REV,North Korean Rev.,FAL,2009,5,2,,,,,81,92,,10.3172/NKR.5.2.81,http://dx.doi.org/10.3172/NKR.5.2.81,,,12,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,514WV,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000271427800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study not only looks closely at textual representations; it also examines how political and ideological changes in North Korea had a critical influence on these texts. The study encompasses both lexico-grammatical analysis and the analysis of textual and visual images, based on an examination of six North Korean language textbooks published from 1954 to 2000. It demonstrates that North Korean identity is defined through the portrayal of non-North Koreans, particularly enemy others. The portrayal of non-North Koreans facilitates the formation of a solid North Korean identity - an identity that entails serving their political leaders, remaining vigilant against threats to their country, and liberating South Koreans from poverty and oppression by America and its puppet states.","Univ Queensland, Sch Languages & Comparat Cultural Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Lee, DB (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Languages & Comparat Cultural Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",isaaclee@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,50,16,19,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1035-7823,,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

In the Korean War the conditions of combat posed large challenges to the recovery and return of bodily remains. Almost half a century after that conflict, the American missing in Korea have become significant players within the government's expanding efforts that were prompted in answer to demands to locate American soldiers who remain unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. The essay traces the background to U. S. military mortuary services and the operation in the Korean War and in the subsequent joint expeditions in North Korea.

J,"Xu, YL; Jin, YZ",,,,Xu Yulan; Jin Yongzhen,,,Ups and Downs: An Analysis of Chinese Image in North Korean Media Based on China-related Reports in Rodong Sinmun from 2009-2020,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korean media; Rodong Sinmun; China-related report; national image; China-North Korea relations,,"Over the past 71 years, the development of relations between China and North Korea has experienced ups and downs. The image of China in the North Korean media is also complicated and changeable, reflecting changes in China-North Korea relations and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Due to the lack of international transparency in North Korea, the analysis of China-related reports by North Korean media has more reference value. This text analyzes the China-related reports in the North Korean mainstream media Rodong Sinmun from 2009 to 2020, and systematically analyzes the main content, reporting trends, changing characteristics, and influencing factors of the North Korean media reports in the past decade. I believe that, since 2009, the North Korean media-related reports have shown that political topics are the most prevalent topics and that cultural exchanges are increasing, while reports on the economy, science and technology, and education continue to decrease. The reports gradually began to pay attention to environmental problems and social events in China. This report on China has shown a general trend - using a deep interpretation to shallow interpretation, then to a multi-angle deep exploration - that the perception of China has been changing from one of intimacy to indifference and then sublimation to the traditional friendly sincere country. Subsequently, the image of China in Rodong Sinmun lacks comprehensiveness and objectivity. It focuses more on explaining and propagating the policies and lines of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The change in China-North Korea relations is the most important factor affecting North Korean media coverage about China. Whenever relations between China and North Korea deteriorate, North Korea makes clear its displeasure with China and sharply curbs its coverage of China. And in every crisis between China and North Korea, North Korea has always maintained relations through the traditional way. This once again proves that the two countries are each other's important strategic partners and both sides have realized each other's strategic value.","[Xu Yulan] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Dept Korean Studies, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Jin Yongzhen] Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Dept Korean Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Normal University; Shanghai International Studies University,"Jin, YZ (corresponding author), Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Dept Korean Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",2418666032@qq.com; 2394584361@qq.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,4,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

By assessing the particular character and identity of Korean cinema in the post-boom years of 2007 to the present, I demonstrate how the industry has recovered some ground since 2007, when the industry faced widespread losses at the box office, the bursting of a film financing bubble and a steep drop in export revenues led many in the film industry to declare a crisis. Since then, although, there is still a sense that Korean cinema has entered a less bountiful era than the one that preceded it, a constantly evolving film landscape continues to offer challenges of many kinds.","[Paquet, Darcy] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Paquet, Darcy] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Kyung Hee University,"Paquet, D (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",darcy@koreanfilm.org,,,,,,,7,4,4,0,3,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"2800 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DAEGU, DALSEO-GU 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2011,14,1,,,,,17,32,,,,,,16,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,887GY,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000299916100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore this article looks past the denuclearization issue, and examines the potential for a future rehabilitation of North Korea's economy in a post-Kim era. Four economic sectors or challenges are analyzed within the context of badly needed North Korean macroeconomic reform: energy utilization and the potential for a new natural gas arrangement with Russia; personal income growth tied to major labor reorientations focused on manufacturing for export; expanding capitalist projects like the Kaesong Industrial Complex; and expanding DPRK foreign trade with South Korea, China, Russia and other countries. This paper's thesis is that once the Kim family legacy of autarchy, corruption, and militarism can be buried, and if a reformist North Korean regime comes forward and institutionalizes state-directed capitalism (as occurred in China and Vietnam), North Korea already has the clear potential to economically develop, shed its tragic legacy, and be welcomed by the international community.","Air War Coll, Montgomery, AL USA",,"Grinter, LE (corresponding author), Air War Coll, Montgomery, AL USA.",,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

Through an analysis of newspaper articles and television programs, we investigate how depictions of language competency become key resources for locating individuals within genealogies of kinship and chronotopic figures of personhood. In some cases, the speech of these celebrities associates them with imaginings of their backwards, low-class Korean kin, the Japanese colonial period, and American military presence, while in other cases, their language is associated with the 21st-century ideal of the modern, elite, globetrotting neoliberal subject. This analysis demonstrates how competence is read in relation to changing notions of citizenship in the new 'multicultural' Korea as these men are differentially positioned between multiple raced, classed, and gendered imaginings of Whiteness and Koreanness. More generally, we argue that understandings of linguistic competence are social productions, rather than reflections of language ability.","[Lo, Adrienne] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kim, Jenna] Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Lo, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 109 Davenport Hall,607 S Matthews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",adr@illinois.edu,,,,,,,41,34,47,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0957-9265,,,DISCOURSE SOC,niscl.

Pitfalls of the Discourses of Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Nuclear Arms Control,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,gray zone discourse; North Korea; nuclear program; denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; nuclear arms control,NORTH-KOREA; DIPLOMACY,"What makes the schemes to address Pyongyang's nuclear program so ineffective? Aside from conventional explanations, two gray zone discourses are at play. First, the gray zone discourse of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has been viable since 1991. Second, another gray zone discourse of nuclear arms control with North Korea has been gathering pace recently. Gray zone discourses blur the line between North Korea and the United States regarding who should be a targeted state. How are gray zone discourses at play in the long process of negotiations and talks? Who is the most likely to win if these gray zone discourses remain intact? These blurred discourses also help North Korea become a recognized nuclear power and a normal state in an international arena. Leaving the distorted mechanism unchecked can encourage a gray zone perpetrator to seize the initiative of tackling nuclear issues, allowing North Korea to achieve a final goal of nuclearization. As part of the efforts to make gray zone discourses unfunctional, three strategic and policy remedies need to be at the forefront: making black-and-white discourses, increasing leverage to North Korea, and establishing a zero-gray-zone strategy.","[Ban, Kil Joo] Inha Univ, CIS Ctr Int Studies, Ctr Secur Studies, Incheon, South Korea",Inha University,"Ban, KJ (corresponding author), Inha Univ, CIS Ctr Int Studies, Ctr Secur Studies, Incheon, South Korea.",raybankj@gmail.com,"Ban, Kil/AAK-8796-2021","Ban, Kil Joo/0000-0002-1195-0664",Fostering a New Wave of K-Academics Program of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS) at the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2021-KDA-1250005],Fostering a New Wave of K-Academics Program of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS) at the Academy of Korean Studies,This work was supported by the Fostering a New Wave of K-Academics Program of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS) at the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2021-KDA-1250005).,,64,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

This cross-sectional study utilized the 6th (2010) Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Participants comprised 74,980 students from 400 middle schools and 400 high schools nationwide. Among these, 73,238 students from 799 schools (38,391 boys, 34,847 girls, aged 13-18 years) were included in the analysis (inclusion rate = 97.7%). Multiple logistic regression and analysis of moment structures (AMOS) analyses were performed to identify meaningful relationships between the three factors. The high risk group of problematic internet usage had increased experience of oral disease symptoms (boys: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.63-2.28, girls: AOR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.50-2.63) compared to the general group. Boys who used the Internet for 5-6 h had a higher risk of oral disease symptoms compared to those who used it for less than 1 h (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-1.53); however, this difference was not significant in Models II and III. For girls, the risk of 5-6 h of use (Model I: OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.40-2.04) was higher than that of the boys. In addition, the difference was significant in Models II and III for girl students who used the Internet for 5-6 h. In subgroup analysis, the high-risk group had a higher odds ratio for mild symptoms of bad breath to severe symptoms such as sore and bleeding gums. In addition, in the path analysis, PIU affected sleep and indirectly affected oral health. Direct and indirect causal relationships between the three factors were confirmed. Therefore, it is important to recognize that PIU can have a detrimental effect on mental, physical, and oral health.","[Do, Kyung-Yi] Catholic Univ Korea, Grad Sch, Dept Publ Hlth, 222 Banpo Daero, Seoul 06591, South Korea; [Lee, Kang-Sook] Catholic Univ Korea, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, 222 Banpo Daero, Seoul 06591, South Korea",Catholic University of Korea; Catholic University of Korea,"Lee, KS (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Korea, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, 222 Banpo Daero, Seoul 06591, South Korea.",dk18684@naver.com; leekangs@catholic.ac.kr,,,,,,,47,35,35,0,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Reframing the Korean Wave as a set of seminal iterations of East Asian pop culture includes its multiplicity and historicity, which enables the delineation of the cultural geography of East Asia as neither a unilateral nor fixed topography but rather something that is constantly re-imagined via pan-Asian pop cultures, materialized through actual encounters, and re-invented through shared historic pasts and modernizing desires. Examining East Asian pop culture also helps to illuminate current structures of feeling in East Asia ('East Asian sensibilities'). The study concludes with suggestions for future collaborative works and theoretical endeavors, which are imperative for the establishment of East Asian pop culture as an object of analysis.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Cho, YH (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,,"Cho, Younghan/0000-0003-0785-5573",,,,,65,75,78,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-2386,1466-4348,,CULT STUD,Cult.

As the methodologically most parsimonious and conspicuous means, this study selected Kim Il Sung's memoir, With the Century, for the key text of the country's strategic culture by referring to previous research; investigated Rodong Sinmun's citation frequencies of the memoir; and derived a relation between the number of citations and the country's annual nuclear and missile activities. Two variables' Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was .88 during the second half of Kim Jong Un's reign (2016-2020), allowing notable comparison with the coefficient of -.41 in the first half of the regime (2011-2015). The significant positive correlation suggests the possibility that Pyongyang has internalized a specific foreign policy perception frame since 2016, which includes maintaining a hanging-tough posture as a default from the previous generations, and entering into negotiations or dialogue defying the conventional wisdom. This logic may serve as a background element of resilience that makes the country return to the hardline attitude upon the occurrence of any slight change in situations.","[Hwang, Ildo] Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Seoul, South Korea",,"Hwang, I (corresponding author), Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Seoul, South Korea.",shamora0125@gmail.com,"Hwang, Ildo/KHW-3462-2024",,,,,,24,0,0,0,3,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Documentary and Cartographic material sourced from Pyongyang's Mining/Resource Ministries and from the pre-Liberation colonial government, during the US Army's occupation of Pyongyang in 1950 allows for new perspectives on the place of these materials within North Korea's web of political and material life. This paper suggests that the nexus of interests and processes which enabled the extraction of Technology Metals and Rare Earths in North Korean would prove vital for the development of Pyongyang's present and future relationships with nature and developmental possibility. The physical and social landscapes generated by this development would later support North Korea in its political quest to capture both real and imagined Socialist modernity.","[Winstanley-Chesters, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, 4325 HC Coombs Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Winstanley-Chesters, R (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, 4325 HC Coombs Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",robert.winstanley-chesters@anu.edu.au,,"Winstanley-Chesters, Robert/0000-0003-0176-1744",Australian Research Council; Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2010-DZZ-3104],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Academy of Korean Studies,"Romanization strategies are considerably different between the two Korean nations.

First, North Korea perceived the level of hostile policy toward it from the U.S. to be steadily increasing, including the Ulchi Freedom Guardian joint military exercises that took place under OPLAN 5015. Second, North Korea interpreted the increased threats from the U.S. and other forces within the context of theories about North Korea's collapse. In other words, the increasingly hostile U.S. policy toward North Korea within the context of theories of North Korean collapse prompted the latter to react harshly against the enemy by enhancing its capability as a nuclear weapons state. Considering the timing of the fourth nuclear test, the opening of the 7th Party Congress of the Workers' Party scheduled for early May 2016 may be regarded as one of the important domestic factors in North Korea's policy-making process. To gain an understanding of North Korean nuclear strategy, this article adopts the neoclassical realist framework, which incorporates domestic factors with systemic incentives.","[Nakato, Sachio] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Int Relat, Kyoto, Japan",Ritsumeikan University,"Nakato, S (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Int Relat, Kyoto, Japan.",snakato@ir.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,,,,,50,2,3,0,31,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2016,47,3,,,,,621,649,,,,,,29,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,DY2XP,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000384955700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article draws on a postcolonial approach to international relations and uses East Asian medicine (EAM)'s principles and epistemological underpinnings as an analytical framework to examine the effects of the inter-Korean border on Korea's body politic and to assess the 2018 inter-Korean border crossings. I demonstrate how the inter-Korean border serves as a site that manifests a new possibility and how invisible ordinary people play an indispensable role in mending the abnormalised Korean body, defying the idea of Korea's intractable conflict. Ultimately, this study rethinks state and non-state interactions, as well as their reciprocal and conflicting relations, in producing, perpetuating and mitigating artificial myths about inter-Korean border conflicts as a conceptual dialogue between state-centred and EAM-inspired approaches towards reconciliation processes. By drawing on the implications of escaping the Westphalian canonical nexus of power-knowledge-discourse, I suggest an alternative way of healing from inside out by de-abnormalising the inter-Korean border and (re)historicising the agency of unseen people in re-imagining the Korean body politic and world politics.","[Lee, Jooyoun] St Edwards Univ, Dept Polit Sci Global Studies Environm Sci & Poli, Austin, TX 78704 USA",Saint Edward's University,"Lee, J (corresponding author), St Edwards Univ, Dept Polit Sci Global Studies Environm Sci & Poli, Austin, TX 78704 USA.",jooyounl@stedwards.edu,,,,,,,66,10,12,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-6597,1360-2241,,THIRD WORLD Q,Third World Q.,APR 12,2024,45,6,,,SI,,1070,1087,,10.1080/01436597.2021.1928488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2021.1928488,,MAY 2021,18,Development Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies,OA8A9,,hybrid,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000656347400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article explores how, through harnessing its unique longstanding relations with both Koreas and investing in non-realist approaches resonant of people-centered engagement, India as a middle power with major power aspirations can lay its footprint softly in Northeast Asia by playing a more pro-active role to bolster and sustain inter-Korean rapprochement and peacebuilding efforts.","[Ouellette, Dean J.] Kyungnam Univ, Inst Far Eastern Studies, Int Affairs, Chang Won, South Korea; [Ouellette, Dean J.] Univ Dept Polit & Diplomacy, Chang Won, South Korea",Kyungnam University,"Ouellette, DJ (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Inst Far Eastern Studies, Int Affairs, Chang Won, South Korea.;Ouellette, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Dept Polit & Diplomacy, Chang Won, South Korea.",ouellett@kyungnam.ac.kr,,,Kyungnam University Foundation Grant,Kyungnam University Foundation Grant,"This work was supported by Kyungnam University Foundation Grant, 2017.",,70,3,3,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

J,"Won, LK",,,,"Won, Lee Kyu",,,The Cholera Epidemic of 1907 and the Formation of Colonial Epidemic Control Systems in Korea,KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,1907; cholera; disease control; Ito Hirobumi; Sato Susumu; Korean Empire; Japanese Resident-General of Korea,,"It was in 1907 when Korea was annexed by Japan in the field of health care systems as the Gwangje Hospital, Uihakgyo the National Medical School and the Korean Red Cross Hospital were merged into the colonial Daehan Hospital, and massive cholera epidemic controls by the Japanese Army were enforced. However, despite their importance, the cholera epidemic of 1907 in Korea and preventive measures taken at that time have not yet been studied extensively as a single research subject. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a more concrete and broader understanding of the Korea-Japan annexation of health care systems under the rule of the Japanese Resident-General of Korea by revealing new facts and correcting existing errors. In 1907, cholera was transmitted to Korea from China and Japan and spread across the Korean Peninsula, resulting in a major public health crisis, perhaps one of the most serious cholera outbreaks in the twentieth century Korea. Although Busan and Pyeongyang were the cities most infected with cholera, the targets for the most intensive interventions were Gyeongseong (Seoul) and Incheon, where the Japanese Crown Prince were supposed to make a visit. The Japanese police commissioner took several anti-cholera preventive measures in Gyeongseong, including searching out patients, disinfecting and blocking infected areas, and isolating the confirmed or suspected. Nevertheless, cholera was about to be rampant especially among Japanese residents. In this situation, Ito Hirobumi, the first Resident-General of Korea, organized the temporary cholera control headquarters to push ahead the visit of the Japanese Crown Prince for his political purposes to colonize Korea. To dispel Emperor Meiji's concerns, Ito had to appoint Sato Susumu, the famous Japanese Army Surgeon General, as an advisor, since he had much credit at Court. In addition, as the Japanese-led Korean police lacked epidemic control ability and experience, the headquarters became an improvised organization commanded by the Japanese Army in Korea and wielded great influence on the formation of the colonial disease control systems. Its activities were forced, violent, and negligent, and many Korean people were quite uncooperative in some anti-cholera measures. As a result, the Japanese Army in Korea took the initiative away from the Korean police in epidemic controls, serving the heavy-handed military policy of early colonial period. In short, the cholera epidemic and its control in 1907 were important events that shaped the direction of Japan's colonial rule.","[Won, Lee Kyu] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Hist Med & Med Humanities, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Won, LK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Hist Med & Med Humanities, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea.",eqone@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,9,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"YONSEI UNIV COLL MED, DEPT MED HIST, 50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 03722, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

The research produced three main findings. First, individual YouTube content creators are most influential in the video networks pertaining to the subject of North Korean defectors. Second, on YouTube space, the image of North Korea tends to be negative because of the prevalence of defectors' testimony of their life experiences. Finally, such negative narratives of North Korea on YouTube might have a negative influence by blocking the reunification of Korea. In conclusion, this study suggests the South Korean government and other relevant global actors should conduct thorough and continuous examinations of North Korean defectors' perceptions of South Koreans and vice versa.

We aimed to analyze the factors affecting Korean medicine health care (KMHC) use for FD. Data from the Korea Health Panel Survey 2017 were analyzed. Individuals aged > 19 years who were diagnosed with FD and used outpatient care were included. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of predisposing, enabling, and need factors with KMHC use for FD, based on Andersen's behavioral model. The best subsets of factors affecting KMHC use for FD were selected using a stepwise procedure. Participants aged 65 years or older were less likely to use KMHC to treat FD than those aged 19 to 34 years (odds ratio (OR), 0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.93). Residents of Busan, Daegu, Ulsan, or Gyeongsang tended to use more KMHC to treat FD than those of Seoul, Gyeonggi, or Incheon (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.02-5.88). Participants with private health insurance were more likely to use KMHC to treat FD than those without private health insurance (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.02-11.42). The prediction model of KMHC use for FD selected sex, age, private health insurance, and stress as the best subset of factors (AUC, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.637-0.781).

This article draws on memoirs by returnee American veterans of the Korean War, as well as Japanese histories of occupation-era prostitution, to shed light on the R&R programme, which has attracted little attention in English. The sexual exploitation of local women during the Korean War influenced the conduct of the programme, which amounted to sex tourism for the US military. The article highlights the harms of the programme for Japanese women who were sold for prostitution to American GIs by compatriot pimps and traffickers. Campaigns for redress over instances of military prostitution, such as the one in support of the comfort women, rely on knowledge cultivated through historical scholarship, so this article contributes to possible future campaigns towards redress for Asian victims of the American military's R&R programme.","[Norma, Caroline] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Norma, C (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",caroline.norma@rmit.edu.au,,,Tubingen University,Tubingen University,The author would like to thank the organisers of the September 2017 Gender(ed) Histories of Korea and Japan conference at Tubingen University for generously supporting the initial presentation and discussion of this article.,,73,3,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

South Korea was first entered into the international refugee regime during the US-led Korean War. And it was due to the neocolonial relationship between South Korea and the US that South Korea participated in the Vietnam War, and consequently, South Korea received its first internationally recognized refugees. Pressure from the US largely explains the burden-sharing role that South Korea played during the Indochinese refugee crisis. However, repositioning itself as a subempire in Asia and seeking enhanced international stature, South Korea signed the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, finally becoming an official member of the international refugee regime.","[Kim, Nora Hui-Jung] Univ Mary Washington, Dept Sociol, Fredericskburg, VA 22401 USA",,"Kim, NHJ (corresponding author), Univ Mary Washington, Dept Sociol, Fredericskburg, VA 22401 USA.",hkim4@umw.edu,,"Kim, Nora/0000-0002-9969-5003",Laboratory ProgramforKorean Studies through theMinistry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2018-LAB-2250001],"Laboratory ProgramforKorean Studies through theMinistry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",Thiswork was supported by Laboratory ProgramforKorean Studies through theMinistry of Education of the Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2018-LAB-2250001).,,40,4,5,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0951-6328,1471-6925,,J REFUG STUD,J.

During a period of political unrest in Japan (1945-1955), some of the Korean residents and Japanese worked together to overcome the culture of Imperial Japan and its assimilative education. They also regarded themselves as people colonized by the United States, and pursued a political-cultural movement for their liberation and independence from American imperialism. The Koreans in Japan rejected compulsory education in the Japanese language. As a result, since 1956, Korean schools (Chsengakk), funded and supported by North Korea, were founded all across Japan. Their ethno-national education was in fact incorporated into North Korean politics, and has been considered in many studies as having overcome Japanese assimilation and ethnic inequalities. Such a view was a result of many academic Zainichi Korean studies that come from an insider's perspective to criticize Japanese colonialism and discrimination. In order to go beyond this insider's view, I focus on the political alliance between Zainichi Koreans and the Japanese people in their pursuit of ethno-national education. Since 2010, the Japanese state funding for Korean schools has become a major controversy in Japan. By tracing the historical background, this article intends to explain why this political issue has arisen. The ultimate purpose of this article is to suggest an ethical perspective to resolve the current political conflict regarding Korean schools in Japan.","Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Japanese Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Jo, GJ (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Japanese Studies, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",joa@snu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-B00006],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2008-362-B00006).

Although broad factors and dimensions can be called upon in this regard, as far as institutional considerations are concerned, a focus will be given to the role of the judicial bodies in constitutional change. Either any abrupt attribution of all the political, social, and economic problems which the Korean society faces to the constitutional system alone and its concomitant idealistic or fundamentalist, partisan and non-consensual drive for comprehensive constitutional amendment as a panacea for such pathologies are doomed to failure. Since any constitutional reform movement should be based upon deliberative consensus on the exact causes of constitutional problems and effective alternatives to the existing constitutional institutions and rules, not only constitutional amendment but also legislative reform and changes in political culture are required for the successful constitutional change. The Korean experience in the first half of Moon Jae-In Government shows that constitutional changes through either formal constitutional amendment or informal change through judicial interpretation of the constitution can be foreseeable and successful only with the steady and firm support of the people.","[Kim, Jongcheol] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jkim386@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Jongcheol Kim/JQW-8778-2023",,Yonsei University,Yonsei University,This work was supported by the Yonsei University Research Grant of 2020.,,58,2,2,0,0,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,,2021,52,4,,,,,575,601,,10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.4.575,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.4.575,,,27,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,YK3AN,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000745090300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trans-Korean Railway, thus, is the key to low carbon development of South Korea. With the Trans-Korean Railway, the export freights for Eurasia can be loaded at a local station for a direct rail transport instead of current d-touring road-ship intermodal transport. This will trigger domestic rail facilitation and reduce road externalities. The corresponding reduction of the shuttle shipment among South Korea-China-Russia may further contribute towards the environmental sustainability of the Yellow and East Seas. Yet, Trans-Korean Railway is considered as a symbol of peace in Korean Peninsula that there has not been a sufficient research on the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the Trans-Korean Railway connection. This paper, accounting on various phenomenal evidence including air pollution (environmental), public health risks and high fatality (social) and logistics inefficiency (economic), argues for the needs to change the discussion perspective on the Trans-Korean Railway from traditional politics to its environmental, social, and economic values.","[Lee, Minha] Korea Univ, Green Sch, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Chung, Suh-Yong] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Chung, SY (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",minha_lee@korea.ac.kr; mahlerchung@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,9815,10.3390/su12239815,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12239815,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PD1HQ,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000597445300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In both, the UN promoted the implementation of modern agricultural and resource management practices, directly tying increased domestic farm and forestry productivity to military success. Through the lens of UN development projects, the Korean War, often characterized as a point of rupture, represented less a moment of disjuncture than it did a period of accelerated continuity.

Zainichi Korean magazines started mostly as outlets for the ethnic Korean community in Japan in the political environment of the 1940s and 50s. Faced with factors such as the division of their Korean homeland and the suppression of Koreans in Japanese society until the 1960s and 1970s, they developed towards conveying a unified voice for the ethnic Korean community in Japan. In the 1980s, the third generation came to account for the majority in the population of the ethnic Korean community in Japan, and their perceptions of the Korean community in Japan, their homeland (Korea), and Japan were different from those of the older generation. The role and stature of Zainichi Korean magazines began to be undermined as an increasing share of the younger generation no longer expected an answer to the question of which source ethnic Koreans in Japan could rely on, now that the age of a collective consciousness had passed. The dwindling role of the Zainichi Korean magazine as an outlet for a collective consciousness was an inevitable trend. As if proving this, in the 1990s Zainichi Korean magazines rapidly lost their cultural dominance in all areas, including literature, politics, history, and popular culture. Since the 2000s, the market for Zainichi Korean magazines has generally been on the decline. Not only is the launch of new magazines dropping rapidly, but they can hardly be said to function as a public forum that can unite the entire Zainichi Korean community. As the specialized nature of the Zainichi Korean media is no longer appealing not only to the younger generations but also the older generations, the drift towards breaking away from the Zainichi Korean media is already a fait accompli. Notwithstanding this, many of the Zainichi Korean magazines are still looking for new roles to play in the midst of a changing environment for the Zainichi Korean community, and the future of Zainichi Korean magazines will depend on their decisions.","[Seungjin, Lee] Univ Konkuk, Acad Mobil Humanities, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Seungjin, L (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, 1209 Saecheonnyeon Ginyeomgwan,120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea.",missest@daum.net,,"Lee, Seungjin/0000-0002-1331-1516",KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University,KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University,This paper was supported by the KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University.,,12,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

After World War II, the Zainichi Korean community took on the challenge of film production for the first time on the strength of GHQ's favorable policies and cultural solidarity with the Japanese socialists. This challenge, which began with newsreels and documentary films, soon entered a long period of stagnation due to the political upheaval of the time, a conflict with GHQ, and deteriorating relations with the Japanese Communist Party. In the 1970s, Zainichi films gradually began to revive, centering on the documentary genre, thanks to Zainichi Korean directors who had learned production skills under progressive Japanese filmmakers. As the mini-theater boom in the 1980s created an environment in which small-scale, non-mainstream films could be distributed and consumed in Japan, Zainichi films gradually expanded their scope through the production of various drama films. At last, the Zainichi Korean film genre finally began to establish itself firmly in Japanese film history. In particular, after the 2000s when the Korean Wave (Hallyu) phenomenon became noticeable in Japan, female directors and South Korean directors emerged to capture minor and workaday issues from multifaceted perspectives, and the general public in Japan enthusiastically consumed their works. Zainichi Korean films continue to strive to embrace both social issues and mass appeal.","[Lee, Seung-Jin] Univ Konkuk, Acad Mobil Humanities, Japanese Literature & Culture, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Lee, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Konkuk, Acad Mobil Humanities, Japanese Literature & Culture, Seoul, South Korea.",missest@konkuk.ac.kr,,"Lee, Seungjin/0000-0002-1331-1516",Konkuk University,Konkuk University,No Statement Available,,16,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

Nora, the play's protagonist, became an icon for women, an emblematic figure representing the pursuit of selfhood. This article aims to historicise the figure of Nora in Korean gender politics as a representation of both the quintessence of modernity and the antithesis of womanly virtue. It specifically examines the tensions in the Korean perception of the character by juxtaposing the adapted representation of Nora that appeared in a Korean novel with the lives of actual New Women, some of whom were labelled in the press as Korea's Nora. Through a close examination of the creative process that took place in the introduction, circulation and appropriation of A Doll's House in colonial Korea, the article demonstrates how the play served not only as a vehicle for experiencing the modern self, but as a proxy for critiquing the notion of Western modernity and feminism that had yet to be localised. It also reveals the significant chasm between the hyperbolic image of the modern Western woman and the locally rooted gender politics among Korean New Women. Such a chasm reflects the tension between local/national demands and transnational lures that both women and men experienced in envisioning modern womanhood.","Australian Natl Univ, Korea Inst, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Choi, H (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Korea Inst, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coll Asia & Pacific, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",hyaeweol.choi@anu.edu.au,,"Choi, Hyaeweol/0000-0002-1934-6971",,,,,63,13,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Through independent arms development in the 1970s, Park's technocrats engineered and launched the modernizing forces that propelled South Korea's rapid economic growth, referred to as the Miracle on the Hangang River. Prom 1973 to 1979, the regime's Heavy and Chemical Industrialization Plan (HCIP) systematically merged civilian industries with a state-controlled system of indigenous weapons production built from the ground up. Drawing strength from a defense-related infrastructure, HCIP rapidly advanced civilian technology and developed a highly skilled labor force, while simultaneously promoting private sector growth and exportation. As select civilian industries produced weapons, military technologies were diffused through spin-off effects that built and expanded private-sector, export-based heavy and chemical industries. Deeply intertwined with economic development and export trade, South Korea's burgeoning defense industry aggressively supported Park's dual pursuits of self-reliance (jaju) in both national security and the economy. The legacy of South Korea's independent military modernization is seen in the state's enduring deep ties with what today represent the most technologically advanced and lucrative commercial industries in the Korean economy.","[Kwon, Peter Banseok] SUNY Albany, Dept East Asian Studies, Korean Studies, Albany, NY 12222 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; University at Albany, SUNY","Kwon, PB (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept East Asian Studies, Korean Studies, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",pbkwon@albany.edu,,"Kwon, Peter/0000-0002-4846-247X",,,,,66,2,2,0,15,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,FAL,2018,58,3,,,,,15,46,,,,,,32,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,GW5PJ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000446987600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

North Korea is currently engrossed in efforts for stabilization of its new regime led by Kim Jong Un. It is expected that for the time being the two Koreas will seek signals to help facilitate a shift in the bilateral situation amid the continuing tense situation. Meanwhile, there remains a high possibility of recurrence of a crisis situation on the Korean peninsula due to accumulated internal conflicts and the unproven leadership of the North's new leader. Concerning the North's nuclear program, it is difficult to expect it will be settled in the way intended at the time of launching the Six-Party Talks. Under such circumstances, the international community's interest is focused on what impact the new defense strategy adopted by the United States, including the planned cuts in the U. S. defense budget over the next decade, will have on the security situation in Northeast Asia. China's military buildup based on its rapid economic development has become one of the main security concerns for the countries in the region. The strategic dilemma associated with China's military buildup looms large, particularly for South Korea, because the bilateral relationship between the two Koreas overlaps with the ROK-U.S. alliance and the relationship between South Korea and China. The best scenario would be if the G-2, i.e. the United States and China, are willing to assume their share of responsibilities and capabilities in pending issues facing the international community, but this could be wishful thinking. The importance of the ROK-U.S. alliance cannot be overemphasized as long as U. S.-China relations remain one of checking up on one another and confrontation, and there are continued threats from North Korea. The South is certainly not alone in wishing to see China's development in diverse sectors, i.e. raised GDP, the establishment of a competitive economic system, key currency, global standards and military power, and increased responsibility and capability for coping with security threats.","ROK Minist Natl Def, Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea",,"Tae-am, O (corresponding author), ROK Minist Natl Def, Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea.",ota108@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,15,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

For a realistic estimation, scenario-based analysis on the marginal abatement costs for each project type and sector has been conducted. Five offset project scenarios (6,000; 12,000; 20,000; 33.000; and 100,000 Korean Won/tCO(2)e) have been selected. It is estimated that there will be 2.44 similar to 3.43 million tCO(2)e of offsets available until 2020.

As part of this broader process, Koreans in occupied postwar Japan, via the platform of the magazine Democratic Korea (Minshu Ch?sen), advocated for a joint process of decolonization and deimperialization whereby both Koreans and Japanese could construct a society free of imperial hierarchies. U.S. Military Occupation policy and censorship, however, thwarted these efforts and disallowed the possibility for the inclusion of a Korean subjectivity within the space of the Japanese nation. Facing intense political pressure, Koreans in Japan started to shift toward a ?non-national? Zainichi Korean subjectivity distinct from the two Korean-nation states established in 1948.

However, the moderating effects of relationship satisfaction differed by gender: For older women, satisfaction with family moderated the association, whereas for older men, satisfaction with friends played a moderating role.Discussion The findings suggest tailoring interventions to improve family relationships for women and friendships for men in mitigating depressive symptoms among functionally vulnerable older adults in Korea, where rapid population aging poses significant challenges to protect functional and mental health among older adults.","[Choi, Ji-Young] Univ Macau, Fac Educ, Macau, Peoples R China; [Sung, Pildoo] Hanyang Univ, Dept Sociol, Seoul, South Korea",University of Macau; Hanyang University,"Sung, PL (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Sociol, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",pildoosung@gmail.com,"; Choi, Ji-Young/IUO-0007-2023; Sung, Pildoo/JAC-8549-2023","Sung, Pildoo/0000-0002-5730-6241;",Hanyang University [HY- 202400000003256],Hanyang University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the research fund of Hanyang University (HY- 202400000003256).",,69,0,0,2,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0898-2643,1552-6887,,J AGING HEALTH,J.

By employing a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), this study provides empirical insights into the longand short-term economic impacts of FTA on the automotive industry. Design/Methodology - This study utilises export data for 2007-2023 and key macroeconomic variables, such as real GDP and exchange rates. A VECM was employed to analyse the relationships between these variables and the volume of Korean passenger cars exported to the US. The model includes dummy variables representing the operational status of Hyundai's Georgia plant and the application of KORUS FTA. The study incorporates the cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) tests to ensure the structural stability of the model. Findings - The results reveal that the KORUS FTA has a significant positive long-term effect on the export volume of Korean passenger cars to the US. Oil prices also positively impact longterm sales. In the short term, the depreciation of the Korean won boosts export growth, whereas interest rate fluctuations have a minimal impact. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests confirm the structural stability of the VECM. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by providing an industry-specific analysis of the impact of the KORUS FTA on South Korean automotive exports. These findings offer policy implications for enhancing South Korean automakers' competitiveness in the global market and formulating future trade agreements.","[Kim, Honyun] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Paik, Seunghoon] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Inst Middle Eastern Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Kang Yen] Hyundai Motor Co, R&D Div, Body Test Team, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hyundai Motors,"Paik, S (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Inst Middle Eastern Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",paik-house@hanmail.net,"; paik, seunghoon/KHW-7846-2024","Kim, Honyun/0009-0006-0631-0589;",,,,,46,0,0,4,4,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"Room #411, Coex Trade Plaza 4F, 513 Yeongdong-daero, Gangnam-gu, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

As colonial subjects, they were governed by colonial civil law which stipulated the freedom to marry, while, as members of monastic communities, they had to observe the temple laws which conferred considerable disadvantages on married monks. One of the restrictions imposed on married monks by the temple laws was that they were not allowed to advance to higher clerical positions, such as that of head monk or abbot. Because it was the colonial government that drafted temple laws and approved the appointment of head monks, the government had to oversee the practice of clerical marriage. However, some monks knew how to evade its surveillance. This paper revisits the issue of clerical marriage and colonial Buddhist policies by examining the double identity of Kim Chonghae, a Korean monk who studied in Japan in the 1910s and served as head monk of the Chondung-sa parish in the 1920s. His double identity is recorded in two household registers: one in which he is listed as a celibate monk and the other in which he appears as a married layman. These records provide evidence of the relationship between the colonial Buddhist policies and the reality of the practice of clerical marriage among Korean monks.",,,,springjeong@gmail.com,"Park, Jeongeun/KDN-4631-2024",,SK SUPEX Fund of Sogang University,SK SUPEX Fund of Sogang University,"The Journal of Korean Religions (JKR)is a peer-reviewedjournal, publishing articles oforiginal research, review articles, book reviews, andissue papers that seek to discuss, elaborate, and extend the study ofKorean religions.

Analysis of the country's energy supply and demand patterns shows that the outdated energy-hungry industries and the waste I use of energy due to a lack of incentives lead to a much higher energy use per unit of gross domestic profit (GDP) than in comparable economies. On the other hand the domestic supply is limited, while the lack of financing sources limits the external supply. The DPRK cannot attain energy security on its own: this is the priority task for international assistance, especially in the context of the Six-Party peace process. Suggested measures include modernization of energy sector management, an internationally-funded system of training of personnel, the modernization of energy sector facilities, the construction of new facilities and innovation. The South Korean role is very important and its assistance should be coordinated with broader international aid in the framework of the Six-Party talks. Multilateral energy assistance arrangements, including a possible consortium should be considered.

This particular method of establishing the key figures of North Korean archaeology reveals the presence of certain archaeologists whose importance has been overlooked within the South Korean discourse on North Korean archaeology. In addition, by tracing the research topics of these key figures over time, a broad understanding of the field of archaeological research in North Korea can be obtained.

A critical rereading of the work is required, however, to capture the paradoxes of postcolonial historiography that are created by the spatial-temporal orders of modernity in a decolonizing, non-Western society. By examining Yi's creative use of historical documentation, such as oral testimonies of filmmakers, this article considers how he offers a counter-narrative against colonialist historiography that denies Korea's agency to transform itself into a modern nation-state without Japanese annexation. However, despite his decolonizing endeavor, his work cannot fully eradicate the colonial effects that inevitably shape postcolonial subjectivity in the globalizing world. In reassessing the possibilities and predicaments of his work, this article reveals Yi's fundamental conundrum as a postcolonial writer living with the effects of colonialism, ultimately challenging the imagination of the postcolonial experience as an uninterrupted struggle to establish an autonomous nation.","[Kim, Hieyoon] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hieyoon.kim@wisc.edu,,,,,,,60,3,3,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-9118,1752-0401,,J ASIAN STUD,J.

For the North Korean regime, nuclear armament can be seen as a means for its survival and negotiation leverage for improving relations with the United States. Since 1993, when the U.S.-North Korea senior officials meetings began, the North has sought a political solution through direct negotiations with the United States on the line that, if the United States tacitly approves its established nuclear capabilities through the freezing of its nuclear facilities, it can resolve U.S. security concerns like nuclear proliferation and long-range ballistic missiles. It remains to be seen if the September 19, 2005 joint statement, which declared the dismantlement of all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, will lead to an eventual resolution of the North's nuclear problem or turn out to be nothing more than another agreement to be reneged on like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the joint statement on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the Geneva Agreed Framework.",,,,yundm@hanafos.com,,,,,,,6,5,5,0,9,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2005,45,4,,,,,9,40,,,,,,32,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,007RR,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000234987800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, this study aimed to compare dietary behaviors and determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as explore factors associated with MetS according to household type among Korean adults. Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018, we included 21,944 Korean adults with available health examination and dietary recall data. Based on self-reported information, individuals were divided into two household types: single-and multi-person households. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MetS and its components after adjusting for potential covariates. Among the study population, 9.19% and 90.81% lived in single-person and multi-person households, respectively. Individuals in single-person households had a higher energy intake overall and a greater percentage of energy from animal protein; total, saturated, and monoun-saturated fats; and animal source foods and a lower percentage of energy from carbohydrates, plant protein, and plant source foods than those from multi-person households (all, p < 0.05). Individuals living in single-person rather than multi-person households were more likely to consume milk/dairy products, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, oils/fats, and others but were less likely to consume vegetables/mushrooms, fruits, seaweeds, and fish/shellfish (all, p < 0.05). Living alone was associated with higher energy intake from main meals and foods prepared away from home but a lower dietary variety score and fewer total main meals consumed (all, p < 0.05). Skipping breakfast, frequent eating out, food insecurity, and MetS combination phenotypes significantly differed by household type. Individuals living alone had higher odds of MetS (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29), abdominal obesity (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.28), elevated blood pressure (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.12-1.47), and elevated fasting blood glucose (AOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.33) than those living with others. Compared with those in multi-person households, individuals in single-person households tend to have health and dietary behaviors that increase vulnerability to MetS; therefore, establishing health care strategies and nutrition policies according to household type is necessary.","[Lee, Kyung Won] Korea Natl Univ Educ, Dept Home Econ Educ, Cheongju 28173, South Korea; [Shin, Dayeon] Inha Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Incheon 22212, South Korea",Korea National University of Education; Inha University,"Shin, D (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",kwlee@knue.ac.kr; dyshin@inha.ac.kr,"Shin, Dayeon/GMX-2004-2022","Shin, Dayeon/0000-0003-0828-184X; Lee, Kyung Won/0000-0003-4430-3241",,,,,59,7,7,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9032,,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,SEP,2021,9,9,,,,,,,1116,10.3390/healthcare9091116,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091116,,,16,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,UV6DG,34574889,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000699565900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Six creative arts therapists were recruited to participate in focus group interviews conducted online between August and September 2022. Additional interview data were collected until February 2023, and the data were transcribed afterward. This paper presents the qualitative part of a descriptive sequential mixed design. Qualitative analysis was performed to analyze the content, and a total of 5 main and 15 subthemes were identified. Taking the improvement in human rights sensitivity via education as the central phenomenon, we identified a pathway from expressing human rights sensitivity to directing human rights education for creative arts therapists. This pathway involved a factor that inhibited human rights sensitivity and a deficiency in human rights education. The results underscore the importance of supporting creative arts therapists in their occupational competencies by improving their sensitivity toward human rights and delivering human rights education that is aligned with their professional characteristics.","[Kong, Soyeon] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Han, Kyeonga] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea",Ewha Womans University; Ewha Womans University,"Han, K (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",63-han@ewha.ac.kr,"Kong, Soyeon/ITW-0637-2023","Kong, Soyeon/0000-0003-2609-0449; Han, KyeongA/0000-0002-6894-6703",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government [2021S1A5B5A17055637],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government [No.2021S1A5B5A17055637] .,,64,0,0,0,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0197-4556,1873-5878,,ART PSYCHOTHER,Arts Psychother.,FEB,2024,87,,,,,,,,102125,10.1016/j.aip.2024.102125,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2024.102125,,FEB 2024,10,"Psychology, Clinical; Rehabilitation",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Rehabilitation,LP4V9,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001188002100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It then empirically analyses how the Korea Trade Commission (KTC) applies this concept in its anti-dumping investigations. The WTO Agreement and disputed cases grant investigating authorities discretion in defining the domestic industry. The KTC likewise exercises this discretion in determining the scope of the domestic industry and interpreting relevant provisions for excluding producers. However, this study identifies inconsistencies in the KTC's interpretation of the domestic industry, particularly regarding industry representativeness. It also highlights the lack of consistent standards in this interpretation. This research reveals that while flexibility is permitted in defining the domestic industry, there are concerns about the consistency and clarity of the KTC's approach. This ambiguity in interpretation and application of standards raises questions about the effectiveness and fairness of KTC's current approach in representing domestic industries in anti-dumping investigations.","[Jung, Sejung] Minist Trade Ind & Energy, Law, Sejong, South Korea",,"Jung, S (corresponding author), Minist Trade Ind & Energy, Law, Sejong, South Korea.",ellery7@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

South Korea and Japan operate with two mutually incompatible sets of historical terms, especially regarding the most sensitive historical issues. Moreover, both governments have been making conscious efforts in language policing, attempting to control the ways in which their respective media refer to anything supposed to be potentially controversial between the two states. Furthermore, the war between the two language-policing regimes across the Straits of Korea has a civil war aspect as well: right-wing historical revisionists in South Korea have been actively appropriating the terminology of their Japanese colleagues while consolidating their opposition to the preferred terminology of the current South Korean government. They have also been exporting to Japan some of the terms they have coined. The present article deals with all the interrelated aspects of the South Korean-Japanese language war. It attempts to explore the ways in which state-level language management regimes have been operating and the interactions between language policies and media language conventions. At the same time, it proposes solutions for overcoming limitations of state language policing and linguistic nationalism.","[Lim, Kyounghwa] Chung Ang Univ, Reconciliat & Coexistence Contact Zones Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Lim, K (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Reconciliat & Coexistence Contact Zones Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.",limkyounghwa0725@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A6A3A03079318],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A6A3A03079318).

This article aims to study how memory initiatives become a crucial component of truth-seeking and reparations processes. The article examines South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the creation of collective memory through symbolic reparations of history revision in education. The South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended a set of symbolic reparations to the state, including history rectification reflective of the truth on human rights violations. Using political discourse analysis, this study compares the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Final Report to the 2016 national history textbook. The article finds that the language of human rights in state sponsored history revisions contests the findings of the truth commission. And in doing so, this analysis argues for the need to reevaluate the government-initiated memory politics even in a democratic state that instituted numerous truth commissions and prosecuted former heads of state.","[Ko, Nusta Carranza] Ohio Northern Univ, Dept Hist Polit Sci & Geog, Polit Sci, Ada, OH 45810 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio Northern University,"Ko, ÑC (corresponding author), Ohio Northern Univ, Dept Hist Polit Sci & Geog, 204B Hill Bldg,525 South Main St, Ada, OH 45810 USA.",n-carranzako@onu.edu,,,,,,,48,7,7,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1750-6980,1750-6999,,MEM STUD,Mem.

J,"Hong, K",,,,"Hong, Kyudok",,,Explaining the Long-Delayed Defense Reform in South Korea,KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,defense reform; South Korean military; civil-military relations; threats from North Korea; Defense Reform Base Plan,,"This study explains why defense reform efforts in South Korea have failed to achieve substantial progress. The outcome would seem all the more unexpected because the Blue House has ostensibly wanted comprehensive defense reform, while the Korean military is also highly motivated to upgrade itself to be able to fight and defend itself against North Korea, which has continuously threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. How should we account for this puzzle? This study focuses on three factors to explain the absence of reform: the role of the president, the opposition from the armed forces leadership, and lapses in the civilian control of the military. This study concludes that South Korea needs to revitalize the reform process in order to successfully confront the security challenges of the twenty-first century. Defense reform has long been dominated by the military leaders. It has resulted in the unwanted situation where civilian leaders have been alienated. Ironically, lack of interest among civilian leaders leads to the lack of support from outside. In order to achieve successful defense reform, assistance from the outside must be guaranteed. South Korea needs to readjust goals and prepare for building robust armed forces to play a decisive role in achieving the mission to meet the requirements of changing strategic environments. The Park administration also needs to take timely steps to overcome its own vulnerabilities, such as modifying its doctrine, equipment, training, and culture. Elimination of its vulnerabilities may involve changes in philosophy, tactics and possibly even modifications to the concepts of operations. All can entail substantial costs. However, the cost of not dealing with the threats is likely to be much higher.","[Hong, Kyudok] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University,"Hong, K (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",kdhong@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,Sookmyung Research Grant [1-0903-0036],Sookmyung Research Grant,This paper was made possible through the support of the Sookmyung Research Grant of 2009 (Grant No. 1-0903-0036).,,24,1,1,1,11,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Between 1945 and the mid-1960s, the North Korean government focused on the translation of Soviet texts, such as Lenin's Collected Works, into Korean. The North Korean elite attempted to learn about Soviet culture and Marxism-Leninism by translating books and magazines from Russian into Korean. They accepted, rejected, or transformed elements of Soviet culture and Marxism-Leninism and applied them to their own context. At the same time, the North Korean leadership launched a Korean-to-foreign language translation project to introduce North Korean texts such as Kim Il Sung's writings to Third World countries. When Kim Il Sung promulgated the Juche idea while visiting Indonesia in 1965, the focus of the North Korean leadership moved from Russian-to-Korean translation to Korean-to-foreign language translation. Previous studies have seen translation in North Korea as a way of importing written texts from the outside world, particularly the Soviet Union. However, this study sheds light on translation as a practice of exporting culture, ideas, and knowledge to the world, notably to the Third World.","[Sunghee, Kim] Soongsil Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Soongsil University,"Sunghee, K (corresponding author), Soongsil Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",kimsunghee@hotmail.com,"Kim, Sunghee/AEN-2541-2022","Kim, Sunghee/0000-0002-5016-5562","Ministry of Education; National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea [NRF-2018S1A6A3A01042723]","Ministry of Education; National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea (NRF-2018S1A6A3A01042723) .",,73,0,0,0,3,KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2023,26,1,,,,,153,176,,10.18399/acta.2023.26.1.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2023.26.1.007,,,25,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,M0LG2,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001027107400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focused on the young generation's perceptions of same-sex sexuality and their attitudes toward same-sex marriage with revisiting Korean Confucianism as a conceptual framework. A total of 110 college students residing in the Seoul metropolitan areas of South Korea participated in this study. The study used participant-generated imagery and face-to-face interviews for data collection. Data were examined using a hybrid approach of thematic analysis that relied on deductive and inductive coding. The results highlighted young Koreans' conflicting perceptions of same-sex sexuality and ambivalent attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Young Koreans perceived lesbians and gay men as marginalized in spite of democratic transition and social movements in South Korea. They showed tolerance to same-sex sexuality under a human rights-based approach. At the same time, the results revealed that they still held on to traditional Korean Confucianism. There are young Koreans opposing same-sex marriage because of their rationale of Confucian heteronormativity, value of social order within collectivism, and belief of familism. The results suggest a reinterpretation of the young generation's ambivalence regarding same-sex sexuality in the light of Confucian-family-oriented collectivism in South Korea.","[Yang, Sungeun] Inha Univ, Incheon, South Korea",Inha University,"Yang, S (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Child Studies, 100 Inha Ro, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",syang@inha.ac.kr,"Yang, Sungeun/KMA-1082-2024",,,,,,30,7,8,4,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,JUL,2021,11,3,,,,,,,2.15824E+16,10.1177/21582440211031886,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211031886,,,9,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,UJ4MB,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000691260200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Lee, H",,,,"Lee, Hyojin",,,A Study on 'Insul (An Art of Benevolence)': Formation of Korean Medical Ethics in Modern Korea,KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY,,,Korean,Article,,,,,,Art of benevolence [Insul(sic)]; traditional Korean medicine; medical ethics in Korea; medical ethics in East Asia; Uisaeng; Eastern and Western medicine in modern Korea,,"Medicine is an art of benevolence [Kr(sic) Insul, Ch(sic) Renshu]. This slogan is widely accepted in East Asia, and at least in South Korea, it is generally regarded as an innate medical ethic. However, the original meaning of `In' ((sic)Ch. Ren), which means `benevolence,' `humanity,' or simply `love for one another,' is a Confucian virtue emphasized by Mencius. It is unclear when this Confucian term became the representative medical ethic in South Korea. The term medical ethic was not coined until the 19th century in the West (Robert Baker and Laurence B. McCullough, eds. 2009). We often use the terms `Insul,' `affection,' `Hippocratic Oath,' and other related concepts interchangeably, but these words come from different times and have different ideological implications (Shin 2000). This paper examines how `Insul' has been recreated under the tensions between Western and Eastern Medicine in modern Korea. The arrival of Western medicine caused an existential crisis in traditional Korean medicine. The status of TKM doctors was demoted by the `Uisaeng Regulation' in 1913 by the JGGK, which aimed to establish a unicameral medical system based on Western medicine. In response, the scientification of Eastern medicine became an inevitable task, and Eastern medicine had to maintain its identity while also modernizing itself to avoid being absorbed into Western medicine. Until the late Joseon period, `Insul' was rarely used in medicine but rather for political practices. Medical practice was a peripheral way of conducting Ren (.), the Confucian benevolence. However, TKM rediscovered the concept during the modern era. With the Convention of Korean Uisaeng in October 1915, the TKM community actively used `Insul' as their identity. At this convention, Governor General Terauchi Mastake used the term to mean traditional medicine and implied that without scientification, `Insul' would be disused. This address was immediately and widely quoted in TKM journals. TKM doctors and adherents interpreted his address to mean that if they could achieve scientification of TKM, their medical ideal (Insul) would be used in the future. Soon, a number of articles on `Insul' as a medical ethic were published in newspapers and journals. From the mid-1920s, regardless of whether the doctors practiced East or West medicine, people started to claim that only those who pursued `Insul' were true medical personnel, and they used this as a criterion for evaluating medical doctors. The people's demand for `Insul' influenced medicine in general, and Western doctors also linked their medical practices to `Insul.' This is an interesting example of the localization of Western medicine in Korea. Through the rivalry relationship or interaction between East and West medicine that took place in modern Korea, `Insul' gradually became a representative term of Korean medical ethics since the mid-1920s. The process took place gradually over a decade, and it has now become firmly established throughout medicine in Korea.","[Lee, Hyojin] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Asian & North African Studies, Korean Studies, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Asian & North African Studies, Korean Studies, Venice, Italy.",hyojin.lee@unive.it,,"Lee, Hyojin/0009-0008-5371-2673",,,,,4,1,1,1,3,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"YONSEI UNIV COLL MED, DEPT MED HIST, 50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 03722, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

The play embraces the memories of the villagers' hometown, Bukcheong, in North Korea, the Korean War, the national division and the loss of their home. People of the diaspora identify themselves as the 'Sokcho people from Bukcheong'. This is also manifested in their changing the name of the play from Sokcho Bukcheong Saja Noreum to Sokcho Saja Noreum. This transition is analysed in terms of some of the main factors of intangible cultural heritage: self-identification, constant re-creation as a response to the historical and social evolution of the community and groups concerned, the connection of heritage to the identity of its creators and bearers, the authenticity of the heritage, and the interrelationship between intangible cultural heritage and human rights.

Combined with other elements in the production and distribution of Korean cultural products that indicate the globalization of Korean cultural industries, the findings of interviews explain that the meaning of the prefix K- is defined by the global popularity of products and the market logic.

This allows us to evaluate implicit claims made about the synchronic forms of these dialects, for example those concerning their relationship to peninsula varieties of Korean, and also provides insights into the factors underlying the development of languages in transplanted contexts. The main findings of this paper confirm that KM and VYK's shared features, such as particle forms and verb endings, are strongly associated with the North Hamgyeong and Yukchin varieties of Korean and their common dialectological origins in the North East of the Korean peninsula. The longevity of these features suggests a 'founder effect' in the development of these transplanted varieties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This collaboration could blur the boundaries between virtual and physical reality, integrate content and form into a metaverse, and establish a new digital economy and ethics. This study also contends that this new wave challenges the notion of cultural product ownership and encourages collaboration across boundaries.

The first is to present the grounds for periodization, layers, and the origin of Sino-Korean, Korean readings of Chinese characters. The second is to discuss major changes in the phonological systems from Middle Sino-Korean to Modern Sino-Korean. This article claims that aspirated consonants, consonantal codas, and tones became phonemic in Middle Sino-Korean, which is claimed to be the closest to seventh to eighth century Middle Chinese. Middle Sino-Korean is notable because it preserved the distinctions of the Middle Chinese four divisions, deng, and doublets, chongniu, unlike many Chinese dialects. Middle Sino-Korean tones were lost by the end of the sixteenth century, which was followed by pre modern Sino-Korean. Alveolar palatalization took place during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It underwent different paths from the alveolar palatalization in Old Mandarin. Beginning from the twentieth century, Modern Sino-Korean faced the loss of a low back vowel [Lambda]. At the same time, monophthongization occurred in four diphthongs, [ai], [ei], [oi], and [wi].","[Eom, Ik-sang] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Eom, IS (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2022S1A5A2A01047785],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2022S1A5A2A01047785).,,61,0,0,3,6,"ACAD SINICA, INST LINGUISTICS",TAIPEI,"NO 130, SEC 2, ACADEMIA RD, TAIPEI, 11529, TAIWAN",1606-822X,2309-5067,,LANG LINGUIST-TAIWAN,Lang.

Objective To examine time trends in FF and SSB consumption and their associations with social environmental status (SEnS) in South Korea. Design Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) were a series of population-based cross-sectional surveys. Participants Data from the KNHANES conducted in 1998, 2001, 2005, and 2007-2009 for 49,826 Koreans aged >1 year were used. Main outcome measures Consumption of FF and SSBs were assessed by a 24-hour recall. We defined two FF categories (Western-style and Korean-style) and one SSB category. Sex, age, household income, and residence regions were investigated. Statistical analyses performed The primary sampling units, strata, and sampling weights were taken into account using SAS survey-related procedures. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between SEnS and FF consumption. Results Over an 11-year period, the proportion of participants' who consumed Western FF and SSBs on the surveyed day doubled (P<0.05). Per capita energy contribution from Western FF also increased in adults, men, and low-income groups. SSB consumption doubled (per capita: 32 to 82 kcal/day, only consumers: 123 to 166 kcal/day), but consumption of Korean-style FF decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the low-income rural resident group, the high-income urban resident group was much more likely to consume Western FF (OR=26.7[3.7, 193.4]) and SSBs (odds ratio [OR]=3.1 [2.4, 4.1]) in 1998. However, in recent years, the patterns changed; the high-income urban resident group was more likely to consume Korean-style FF (OR=2.0[1.3, 2.9]) and SSBs (OR=1.7 [1.3, 2.1]). Conclusions In South Korea, people who reported consuming Western FF and SSBs on the surveyed day almost doubled during 1998-2009, whereas those who consumed Korean FF decreased. SEnS was related to FF and SSB consumption.","[Lim, Hyunjung; Choue, Ryowon] Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch East West Med Sci, Dept Med Nutr, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, South Korea; [Lim, Hyunjung; Choue, Ryowon] Kyung Hee Univ, Res Inst Med Nutr, Yongin, South Korea; [Lee, Hae Jeoung] Gachon Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Seongnam, South Korea; [Wang, Youfa] Ball State Univ, Fisher Inst Hlth & Well Being, Muncie, IN USA; [Wang, Youfa] Ball State Univ, Fisher Inst Hlth & Well Being, Dept Nutr & Hlth Sci, Coll Hlth,Syst Oriented Global Childhood Obes Int, Muncie, IN USA",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University; Gachon University; Ball State University; Ball State University,"Lim, HJ (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch East West Med Sci, Dept Med Nutr, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, South Korea.",hjlim@khu.ac.kr,"Lim, Hyunjung/AAJ-4089-2020; Zhao, Yang/IXD-7496-2023",,Korea Centers for Disease Control Prevention [2011E3501000]; US Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); National Institute of Health (NIH) [U54HD070725]; NICHD; Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR),Korea Centers for Disease Control Prevention; US Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); National Institute of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR),"The study was supported in part by Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (No. 2011E3501000) and the US Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD), National Institute of Health (NIH, U54HD070725).

J,"Park, J",,,,"Park, Jeongeun",,,The Making of Modern Monastic Families in Colonial Korea: An Examination of Master-Disciple Relations in Monks' Household Registers,JOURNAL OF KOREAN RELIGIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Modern Korean Buddhism; colonial Korea; customary law; household registers (minjok or hojok); master-disciple relationship; monastic family,,"When the modern household registration system was introduced to Korea by the Japanese in 1909, Korean Buddhist monks were smoothly incorporated into it. At the time, most monks might not have realized the tremendous change the modern household registration was bringing about: the beginning of secularization. In the early colonial period Korean monks were allowed to claim their disciples as adopted sons in household registers because the Japanese colonial government acknowledged this pseudo-family relationship in Korean monastic communities as conventional Korean Buddhist practice. When the household registration law was revised in 1915, however, the colonial government decided that monks would no longer be permitted to do this, with the revised law stating that only married men were able to adopt male heirs from patrilineal kin. As a result, Korean monks had to follow the colonial government's instructions that focused on the creation of the ideal modern family for its colonial subjects. In short, the conflict between the Japanese colonial government's civil law and Korean monks' traditional understanding of the relationships between novice clerics and teachers catalyzed the transformation of Korean monks' concept of the monastic family. As specific examples, this paper will examine the original and revised household registers of the monk Yu Poam of Kwijusa and the monk Yi Taeryon of Konbongsa.","[Park, Jeongeun] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Asian Studies, Charlottetown, PE, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island,"Park, J (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Asian Studies, Charlottetown, PE, Canada.",springjeong@gmail.com,"Park, Jeongeun/KDN-4631-2024",,"Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea [AKS-2017-INC-2230001]; Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS); Academy of Korean Studies (AKS)","Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS); Academy of Korean Studies (AKS)","This work was supported by an international Seed Program for Korean Studies grant (AKS-2017-INC-2230001) through the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service (KSPS), the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS).",,35,2,2,0,3,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

Despite their escape from a politically and economically repressive setting, NK refugees continue to face multidimensional hardships during their adaptation process in South Korea, which can adversely affect their mental health. However, to our knowledge, no empirical research exists to date on depressive symptoms in the context of adaptation or perceived discrimination among NK refugees. To fill this gap, this study used a sample of 261 NM refugees in South Korea from the 2010 National Survey on Family Violence to examine associations between sociocultural adaptation, perceived discrimination, and depressive symptoms, as well as the moderation effect of discrimination on adaptation to depressive symptoms. We found that poor sociocultural adaptation and perception of discrimination were associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms. Perception of discrimination attenuated the association between better adaptation and fewer depressive symptoms, when compared to no perception of discrimination. These findings highlight the need to improve NK refugees' adaptation and integration as well as their psychological well-being in a culturally sensitive and comprehensive manner. They also underscore the importance of educating South Koreans to become accepting hosts who value diversity, yet in a homogeneous society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the financial support is still anemic compared to financial support for K-12 education. This paper first explain the current situation and problems of financial support for higher education and then suggest policy implications. There are 9 hindrances to securing university funding in Korea: instability, small total allocation, overlapping investments by central government, inconsistency in program promotion goals, connectedness to university structural reform, imbalance among financial support targets, opaqueness of financial support predictability, private university financial structures that heavily depend on tuition fees, and various causes of increases in tuition. Here are several possibilities for solving financial problems in universities and for securing financial support from the government: Financing Higher Education Grants, a higher education tax, formula funding, support for local universities, support for private universities, and financial support that is oriented to consumers. Directions for state subsidies programs can be categorized as follows: financial support that considers both of equity and excellence, unified administration of governmental support funds, reductions of program support, operating expense support to private universities, and dividing financial support for private universities by their financial condition. The key tasks to solve the problem of financial structure in Korean higher education are three such as high dependency on private institutions, heavy dependence on tuition, and the government's minimum investment rules. There should be discussions about high dependency on private resources for university education financing.","[Kim, Byoungjoo] Yeungnam Univ, Coll Educ, Gyongsan, South Korea; [Park, Namgi] Gwandu Natl Univ Educ, Gyongsan, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Park, N (corresponding author), Gwandu Natl Univ Educ, Gyongsan, South Korea.",kimbj@ynu.ac.kr; ngpark@gnue.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education,Ministry of Education,"The actual financial support decreases when excluding National Scholarship Expenditure (US$1.6 billion dollars) including Korean Scholarship Foundation (285 thousand dollars).

From 1592 to 1598, the Choson dynasty suffered invasions from Japan that displaced much of the Korean population and devastated the economy and environment. The crucial role of the navy during the war, along with a dire postwar situation, heightened government anxieties about deforestation and timber scarcity. Thus, in the seventeenth century, the Choson government expanded administration over forests, particularly pine forests, across the coasts and islands of southwestern Korea. The key vehicle for the expansion was the military.

We analyzed the data from surveys and medical examinations of 394 North Korean refugees adjusting to their new lives in South Korea to better understand the relationship among socio-cultural adjustment, psychological adjustment, and physical health. Specifically, we focused on resting heart rate, as an important indicator of physical health. Our results showed a positive association between sociocultural adjustment and psychological adjustment. Furthermore, we detected a so called inconsistent mediation that socio-cultural adjustment had a positive direct effect and a negative indirect effect on resting heart rate via psychological adjustment. These findings imply a double-edged role of socio-cultural adjustment. On the one hand, socio-cultural adjustment to the fast-paced and stressful life in an industrialized country may reduce physical health; while on the other hand, it may improve mental health, which in turn results in better physical health. Additional results also revealed the direct and indirect influence of refugees' employment status on resting heart rate, implying that refugees who work are better adjusted and have better health.

How effective were the financial guarantee and public investment programs as part of the counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the recovery process from the crisis?

In explaining the motivation for and intention of this special religious event in the political arena, most scholars have emphasized the Protestant leaders' political ambition and their agendas to get the government support and expand their power in Korean society. However, we should take heed of the leaders' religious aspirations to make the country righteous in God's sight. They attempted to have a good influence on the inner circle of the military dictatorship, which some Christians regarded as an evil force. Though they preached to and prayed for the military regimes, their sermons were often unpleasant and challenging to the presidents and their associates.

The study is grounded in a distinction between the documentaries before and after this period in terms of the feminist politics and the social actors that these films address and engage. In so doing, it argues for three implications of twenty-first century Korean feminist documentary cinema as follows: first, rather than remaining with little remarkable change, the activist tradition of Korean independent documentary has been renewed and revamped in its continual intersections with the shifting social movements for women's rights; second, since the mid-2010s, the agendas of feminist documentary have been diversified to the extent that they include not simply the lives and voices of disenfranchised women as a key social subject of traditional activist filmmaking before that period, but also the corporeal and affective dimensions of women's identity, such as abortion and menstruation, and their relation to women's sociality; and finally, in dialogue with this differentiation of feminist issues, the modes and styles of documentary filmmaking have been so varied that they embrace reenactment, urban ethnography, personal documentary, and the filmmaker's presence in the text. This is particularly evident in the corpus of Kangyu Garam, a younger-generation woman documentarian who has prolifically demonstrated her authorship with her middle-length and feature-length documentaries devoted to portraying and recording the and time of various women.","[Jihoon, Kim] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Jihoon, K (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jihoonfelix@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,5,ATENEO DE MANILA UNIV,QUEZON CITY,"SCH HUMANITIES, DEPT ENGLISH, LOYOLA HEIGHTS, QUEZON CITY, 1108, PHILIPPINES",2094-6937,,,KRIT KULT,Krit.

Thus, the present study aims to provide basic data to seek solutions for ideal physical activities and right body image perception by comparing health-related behaviors of women at normal BMI. Among the 39,225 respondents from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) conducted from 2013 to 2017, 10,798 adult women with World Health Organization (WHO) BMI Classifications of 18.5 <= BMI < 25 (Asia-Pacific) were considered, from which pregnant and breast-feeding women and women whose body image perception was not identified were excluded, leading to a total of 9288 women. Data were analyzed utilizing SAS ver. 9.4 for frequency analysis, cross tabulation, GLM (generalized linear model), and logistic regression analysis with complex samples design, in conformity with the guidelines of the KNHNES. The results showed that approximately most (87.6%) of adult Korean women misperceived their body image. Misperception of body image was related to inappropriate health-related behaviors such as smoking, insufficient sleeping, and excessive body weight management; those who had underestimated their body image (<= 64 odds ratio (OR) (0.718 (confidence interval (C.I.) 0.594-0.866))) carried out fewer health-related behaviors, while women aged 65 or above engaged in more health-related behaviors when they perceived themselves as obese (OR 1.683 (C.I. 1.260-2.248; overestimation)). To sum up, it was found that lack of health management, inappropriate body weight control, and health-related behaviors are related to body image misperception compared with real BMI. As such, it is necessary to have educational programs to encourage building proper perception of one's body image and body weight, and to carry out health-related behaviors.","[Park, Seyeon] Daejeon Hlth Inst Technol, Dept Nursing, 21 Chungjeong Ro, Daejeon 34504, South Korea; [Shin, Jieun] Woosuk Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, 443 Samnye Ro, Wanju Gun 55338, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Baek, Seunghui] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Hlth Exercise Management, Bomun Ro 34da Gil, Seoul 02844, South Korea",Woosuk University; Sungshin Women's University,"Shin, J (corresponding author), Woosuk Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, 443 Samnye Ro, Wanju Gun 55338, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.;Baek, S (corresponding author), Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Hlth Exercise Management, Bomun Ro 34da Gil, Seoul 02844, South Korea.",sy_park@hit.ac.kr; shinjieun_80@naver.com; sh100@sungshin.ac.kr,,"shin, Jieun/0000-0002-6192-2610",,,,,50,8,9,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This article focuses on the securitization process of international political issues and security-building processes between two nations. Specifically, this study intends to specifically look at the following four aspects of security: nation states' perceptions of security, securitization, the security-building process, and potential security threats. In this respect, the article begins by redefining the definition of security and economic security and applying their relevance to the Russian-South Korean bilateral relations.

Predicated upon the historical-institutional details of the development of welfare programs, this article examines and elucidates how the instrumentalization of welfare policy-making since the onset of state-led industrialization and the progress of electoral democracy since the democratic transition have hindered the implementation of effective anti-poverty policies. It argues that the exponential politicization of welfare issues amid the demise of the agenda-setting and implementation capacity of the welfare bureaucracy has resulted in a political preference for low-benefit, quasi-universal solutions without an increase in taxes or contributions, which has crowded out the policy option of imposing sufficiently generous measures targeted at this vulnerable segment of society. As pervasive elderly poverty persists, old-age welfare has been substantially privatized and dualized, compelling seniors to find market-based alternatives or to work in low-paying precarious has declined, impeding the formation of pro-welfare solidarity despite the overall growth of the universalist welfare system and popular democracy.","[Kim, Sunil] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",sunilkim@khu.ac.kr,"; Kim, Sunil/AAF-7950-2021","Kim, Sunil/0000-0002-5550-0462;",,,,,161,1,1,0,5,PACIFIC AFFAIRS UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,VANCOUVER,"376-1855 WEST MALL, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z2, CANADA",0030-851X,1715-3379,,PAC AFF,Pac.

The article also explores how much Japanese and South Korean reshoring from China, a subset of foreign economic policy, counts as economic statecraft as a deliberate government attempt to achieve geopolitical objectives using 'economic' means. One would expect these governments, which innovated proactive industrial policies and guided the private sector to catch up with developed economies in the 20th century, to have an easy time encouraging businesses to re-shore. While these two governments have employed various policy instruments to shift their economic dependence away from China, there is only limited success in motivating businesses to return to their homeland. This leads to an intriguing departure in our understanding of the capacity of those two Asian nations, which used to be considered prototypical 'developmental states' where governments have significant influence over business behaviour. This research brings more nuance and complexity to prevailing state-as-unitary-actor assumption of the economic statecraft literature and advocates closer attention to domestic sources of foreign economic policy.","[Katada, Saori N.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Lim, Ji Hye] George Mason Univ Korea, Global Affairs, Incheon, South Korea; [Wan, Ming] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Fairfax, VA USA",University of Southern California; George Mason University,"Lim, JH (corresponding author), George Mason Univ Korea, Global Affairs, Incheon, South Korea.",jlim18@gmu.edu,,"Wan, Ming/0000-0002-3093-5929; Katada, Saori/0000-0002-1030-4222; Lim, Ji Hye/0009-0004-7878-0059",,,,,79,8,8,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

These return migrants, or the Chosonjok, have been received by their South Korean co-ethnics into what may be called a hierarchical nationhood. The strategies of temporal displacement, this article contends, are employed in South Korean cinema and television dramas in order to contain the uncanny cultural difference embodied by these ethnic returnees. As a result, a certain sense of belatedness is inscribed on the bodies of these migrants. If this temporal refiguration wards off the psychological discomfort of dealing with difference in the midst of sameness, it may be said at the same time to fetishize its object within an archaic constellation that South Koreans find endearing, yet disturbingly absent, from their highly consumerist contemporary society.

Culture encompasses more than just extensive opportunities for exchanges and collaboration between countries - it catalyzes the formation of new opportunities for cultural synthesis that can change its creative potential and forms of engagement in regional and transnational collaboration. The attitude towards national culture as a phenomenon of which aspects can be reconceived and reformulated in terms of international collaboration as aspects of politics, economy and culture opens up both new potential for its mobility, and also its transformative creative power. In this context, discourses of collaboration between agents serve not only as factors for the organization of a collaborative sociocultural environment, but also as prerequisites for a cultural and creative hybridity, which is actively formed in environments where cultural boundaries are less pronounced. Through a new public diplomacy, studying the cultural prospects of relations between the Republic of Korea and Russia allows us to discuss the concept that forms of cultural synthesis that arise in the course of development of long-term humanitarian exchanges (educational, scientific, and others) provide the foundation for us to address the prospects of South Korean-Russian relations from the new angle of cultural hybridity in the 21st century. The buildup of culture at the hands of representatives of Russian and Korean culture produces a uniquely creative experiment in cultural collaboration.","[Kuropjatnik, Alexandr I.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Cultural Anthropol & Ethn Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Yang, Mina] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Saint Petersburg State University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kuropjatnik, AI (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Cultural Anthropol & Ethn Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia.",alkuropjatnik@mail.ru; minayang919@naver.com,"Yang, Mina/KRO-6266-2024; Kuropjatnik, Alexander/G-6022-2015","yang, mina/0000-0001-9606-5359",,,,,38,0,0,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

The second part looks at questions of style and literary quality in the DPRK through a comparative analysis of multiple novels grouped by degree of literary prestige. It introduces a method to evaluate the originality of an author's writing style using a masked language model (BERT) and uses it to assess the role of conformity and originality in the DPRK's literary field. Even though writers consecrated by the state display a high level of stylistic conformity when writing mandated biographies of the ruling family, their independent output ranks higher in originality than nonconsecrated writers.","[Berthelier, Benoit] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Berthelier, B (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",benoit.berthelier@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,93,0,1,4,7,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0021-9118,1752-0401,,J ASIAN STUD,J.

Analyzing LTI programs and participants in un policymaking and implementation, I advocate reconsideration of the conventional theorization of the state as either strong or weak in its control over national culture, corresponding to the degree of liberalization of market and politics. Instead, the institutional strength of the state and the marginal status globally of a given literature are intertwined and mutually transformative for the global formulation of a national literature. This study articulates how LTI's embeddedness in networks of domestic and international literary actors, such as translators, publishers, academics, and critics, both enables and constrains LTI policy. Based on the analysis, I argue that LTI as an intermediary formulates Korean literature with multiple components, combining the marketization of prominent writers with cultural consecration of non-commercial works, and universal literary values with nationalist cultural pride. Consequently, this study reveals the contentious nature of the state-led literary project, under which a national literature in global context is shaped collectively by actors both within and without the state.","[Shim, Bo-Seon] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Commun & Arts, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Shim, BS (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Commun & Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",bosobored@yonsei.ac.kr,"; Shim, Boseon/LFR-8900-2024","Shim, Bo-Seon/0000-0001-7444-653X;",,,,,53,1,1,2,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1479-5914,1479-5922,,INT J ASIAN STUD,Int.

An integrated 'political economy' theoretical framework is used to analyse the complex interaction of institutional, strategic and micro-political forces that have shaped the hybrid model of employment relations at BHMC. The study shows that the transfer of policies and practices from Ulsan to Beijing has been influenced not only by institutional differences between the home and host countries and the strategies pursued by HMC management, but also by the political contests between various actors within and outside BHMC. Our research findings show that HMC headquarters has sought to maintain control over employment relations at BHMC through the transfer of its core policies and practices from its Korean operations to BHMC. However, a hybrid model has emerged at BHMC with some notable differences to HMC's Ulsan plant. Utilising an integrated political economy perspective, this contribution has shown that BHMC's employment relations policies and practices have been shaped and conditioned by a complex interplay of institutional and market forces, strategic choices and ongoing political contests between various actors within and beyond BHMC.","[Zou, Mimi; Lansbury, Russell D.] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Lansbury, RD (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",r.lansbury@econ.usyd.edu.au,"Zou, Mimi/M-7892-2016","Zou, Mimi/0000-0001-7076-635X",,,,,53,14,15,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-5192,1466-4399,,INT J HUM RESOUR MAN,Int.

With growing dangers of conflict escalation and nuclear use, it is time to consider alternative policies that address the reality of North Korea as a nuclear possessor state. Comprehensive arms control is worth exploring as one potential approach to managing nuclear dangers on the Korean Peninsula. Previously, conventional arms-control and denuclearisation negotiations with North Korea proceeded in parallel. However, the increasing complexity of deterrence resulting from changes in military capabilities, especially in South Korea, now necessitates a comprehensive process that creates linkages across conventional and strategic domains to address not just North Korean and South Korean, but also US, capabilities. Though comprehensive arms control promises to be politically fraught and technically complex, policymakers and experts should debate whether it could yield a more secure Korean Peninsula than existing policies that have long since failed.","[Dalton, Toby] Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Nucl Policy Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Kim, Jina] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Language & Diplomacy, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jina] KIDA, North Korean Mil Div, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Dalton, T (corresponding author), Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, Nucl Policy Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; Korea National Defense University,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; Korea National Defense University,This study was supported by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund and a research grant from the Korea National Defense University.,,37,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-6338,1468-2699,,SURVIVAL,Survival,JAN 2,2023,65,1,,,,,21,48,,10.1080/00396338.2023.2172847,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2023.2172847,,,28,International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations; Government & Law,9A6TJ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000934188000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on ethnographic research conducted in Frankfurt in 2022, this research explores multiple situational factors across socio-structural layers influencing Korean restaurant owners in their decision to open their businesses. The study found that the economic, cultural, and social contexts in Germany, such as visa and settlement schemes, market conditions, and the cosmopolitan lifestyle in Frankfurt have been vital factors for Korean immigrants in Germany while ethnic networks and resources have been inconsequential. Korean restaurant owners in Frankfurt also contribute greatly to the shaping of trends in terms of interest in Korean food and culture in the host society through their own agency and in their interactions with local people. In the context of a rapid rise in popularity of Korean culture and food internationally, this study points to an uneasy fit between the case of Korean restaurant owners in Frankfurt and the prevailing conceptual frameworks of immigrant entrepreneurship in Europe, leading to the need to approach their case from new angles.","[Kim, Jihye] Univ Cent Lancashire, Preston, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Preston, England.",jkim22@uclan.ac.uk,,"Kim, Jihye/0000-0002-4254-7114",Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2022-R-065],Academy of Korean Studies,This research was supported by the 2022 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2022-R-065).,,55,2,2,4,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

The dimensions of language, identity, and cultural participation as well as the number of years living in the United States were analyzed. The main findings include the following: (a) parents who maintain heritage culture orientation were more likely to preserve traditional parenting values and practices, (b) parental host culture orientation largely had no effect on traditional parenting, but some elements of the host culture orientation were in fact associated with stronger endorsements of traditional parenting, (c) each dimension of acculturation differentially related to traditional parenting, and (d) significant relationships were more pronounced among parenting values than practices. These patterns were largely similar across mothers and fathers.

Following the Japanese Empire's demise, however, Japanese wives in Korean families faced new political dynamics and their ethnic belonging became an issue. This article introduces the experiences of some Japanese women who married leftist zainichi Korean men in the 1950s and 1960s, obtained through interviews and published memoirs. Their self-identification exclusively as members of the zainichi Korean community - or their experiences of becoming Korean, despite facing oppression in both the Korean community and Japanese society reflect the specific historical moment of Korean decolonization in post-imperial Japan. Their stories attest that Koreans' efforts toward decolonization led to the establishment of an autonomous ethnic sphere and a new center of moral authority among zainichi Koreans. These women stood at the boundary between Korean and Japanese social spheres, which developed based on the malleability in women's senses of ethnic and national belonging.

Was Japan simply the beneficiary of the wartime boom - a case best exemplified by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru's characterization of the Korean War as a gift of the gods? When North Korean troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel and launched a full-scale attack against South Korea, the U.S. occupation in Japan quickly transformed the pacifist nation into the indispensable rear base of United Nations military intervention in the Korean War. The Japanese Communist Party and leftist groups organized by zainichi Koreans (Korean residents in Japan) launched an antiwar movement to stop Japan from producing and sending arms to UN forces in Korea. The U.S. occupation responded with determined efforts to contain every antiwar voice emerging from the streets of the pacifist country. By examining the political dynamics of zainichi Korean and Japanese leftist solidarity and U.S. countermeasures, this article shows how the Korean War was fought in pacifist Japan.

The text of the first wave is represented by eight Korean television serials popular in the recipient countries of the first Korean Wave, while the text of the second is the ten K-pop music videos most viewed on You Tube. The results show that the structures of appeal of the texts of the two phases are quite distinct from one another. The appeal of the first wave texts is based on symbolic pleasure, but that of the second lies on the imaginary. Korean television serials reflect Korean society and their global fans partake in and share Korean fantasies and dreams. K-pop is of the Lacanian imaginary and excludes the social; it may be its aspiration to avoid the symbolic and indulge in the imaginary plenitude that appeals to global fans of K-pop.","Korean Womens Dev Inst, Equal Policy Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Korean Womens Dev Inst, Equal Policy Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.",lsy4026@kwdimail.re.kr,,,,,,,22,20,27,0,30,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2012,43,3,,,SI,,447,469,,,,,,23,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,018CM,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000309637600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, studies about Korean foreign direct investment (FDI) associated with the Hallyu phenomenon are still scarce. Thus, this study attempts to investigate Korean FDI that flows to Indonesia under such a phenomenon. Data was collected through documents and relevant video reviews which was then followed by a key informant interview. The findings showed that the rising trend of Korean pop music in Indonesia has gradually stimulated Korean investors to invest in industries promoting the transmitted Hallyu culture, such as broadcasting, TV and video production, sound recording and music publishing. Despite the amount of investment remaining lower than in the heavy and manufacturing industries, the study indicates an increase in Korean FDI in Indonesia's content industries due to the high demand for Korean cultural content and the country's ongoing bilateral commitment to South Korea. This study adds to our understanding of how global familiarity with a cultural phenomenon may affect FDI inflows to the country from which that phenomenon originates.","[Drianda, Riela Provi] Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, Nishi Waseda 1-6-1 Shinjuku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Kesuma, Meyriana] Tarumanagara Univ, Dept Architecture, Jl Letjen S Parman 1, Jakarta 11440, Jakarta Barat, Indonesia; [Lestari, Nadia Ayu Rahma] Tarumanagara Univ, Jalan Letjen S Parman 1, Jakarta 11440, Jakarta Barat, Indonesia",Waseda University; Tarumanagara University; Tarumanagara University,"Drianda, RP (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, Nishi Waseda 1-6-1 Shinjuku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",reetea.bdg@gmail.com; meyrianakesuma@gmail.com; nadiarahma@ft.untar.ac.id,"Lestari, Nadia/ACM-6355-2022",,,,,,60,1,1,1,14,LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"4 CAMBRIDGE ST, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZU, ENGLAND",1474-6743,1478-3401,,INT DEV PLANN REV,Int.

This study specifically endeavors to know their experiences in the job seeking process and working situation which includes salary, promotion, and treatment from South Korean co-workers. While this study focuses on female Saetermins, it aims to locate their experiences as job seeker and worker in comparison with male Saetermins,, in order to know gender difference of their situation. To accomplish the purpose, the method of study uses comprises both statistical data analysis and in-depth interviews with Saetermins.. The findings on survey are that: (1) Saetermins have more difficult experiences during the job seeking process than South Koreans (2) they have fewer job opportunities compared to South Koreans (3) in terms of working situation, they are paid less and have fewer chances for promotion than South Korean co-workers; (4) they have often experienced being ignored or excluded by South Korean co-workers at the workplace; (5) gender differences between female and male Saetermins are not found to be statistically significant; (6) but, the result of in-depth interview reveals that female Saetermins adapt more easily than male Saetermins during the job seeking process and the working life.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst E Asian Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Park, YJ (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst E Asian Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,4,SOOKMYUNG WOMENS UNIV,YOUNGSAK-KU,"RES INST ASIAN WOMEN, CHEONGPA-RO 47NA-GIL36, YOUNGSAK-KU, SEOUL 04309, SOUTH KOREA",1225-925X,2586-5714,,ASIAN WOMEN,Asian Women,SUM,2008,24,2,,,,,17,42,,,,,,26,Women's Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Women's Studies,366FR,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000260466500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

General social support and both sources of religious support were all related positively to life satisfaction and negatively to depression. Moreover, even after controlling for 5 demographic covariates (gender, education, income, age, and years in the United States), attendance, and general social support, these findings were maintained for both God support and religious community support regarding life satisfaction but not depression. Conversely, after controlling for the same 5 covariates, attendance, and religious support, general social support's relationship was maintained with depression but not with life satisfaction.

However, the governments of the two Koreas pursued different goals in the 1960s, which resulted in a reversal. The South Korean government made economic growth its ultimate goal. They did this by self-implementing, adjusting and instituting an export-oriented development strategy. On the other hand, the North Korean government tried to maximise its ability to survive by sacrificing gains from economies of scale. These differences brought about remarkable differences in economic performance. The gap between the two economies has continued to grow since the income level reversal in the 1970s.","[Kim, Duol] Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Myongji University,"Kim, D (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",duolkim@mju.ac.kr,,"Kim, Duol/0000-0003-1688-937X",,,,,123,2,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

While there are volumes of studies on 'New Confucianism', the focus remains mostly on Chinese academics; however, just like Song-Ming, Neo-Confucianism spread throughout East Asian countries, where a unique and distinct Neo-Confucian model emerged with its own arguments and debates. The New Confucianism that appeared at the turn of the 20th century in an attempt to embrace Western cultural power within a Confucian value system has also been extended and widely adopted in Korea and has transformed itself according to its socio-political environment. Pak and Yi, who lived during and after the Japanese colonial period, struggled to grasp a sense of autonomy as the unique Korean tradition and spirit was about to be swept away by a flood of foreign ideas and social turmoil. Although the two thinkers differed in their approaches-Pak studied Western philosophy and Yi Chinese New Confucianism-they devoted their life to uncovering and systematizing the distinctive structure of Korean traditional philosophy and thereby laid the cornerstone of New Korean Confucianism.","[Gao, Xing-Ai] Yanbian Univ, Sch Marxism, Dept Ideol & Polit Educ, Jilin 133002, Yanji, Peoples R China; [Chung, So-Yi] Sogang Univ, Sch Humanities, Dept Religious Studies, Seoul 04107, South Korea",Yanbian University; Sogang University,"Gao, XA (corresponding author), Yanbian Univ, Sch Marxism, Dept Ideol & Polit Educ, Jilin 133002, Yanji, Peoples R China.;Chung, SY (corresponding author), Sogang Univ, Sch Humanities, Dept Religious Studies, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",goosungae@ybu.edu.cn; soyichung@sogang.ac.kr,,,Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2022-R-037]; Chey Institute for Advanced Studies' International Scholar Exchange Fellowship; National Social Sciences Funding for the Western Project A Critical Study of Zhu Xi's Theory in Modern Korea [22XZX014],Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies; Chey Institute for Advanced Studies' International Scholar Exchange Fellowship; National Social Sciences Funding for the Western Project A Critical Study of Zhu Xi's Theory in Modern Korea,"This research was funded by the 2022 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2022-R-037), the Chey Institute for Advanced Studies' International Scholar Exchange Fellowship for the academic year of 2020-2021, and 2022 National Social Sciences Funding for the Western Project A Critical Study of Zhu Xi's Theory in Modern Korea (1876-1945).

In the early 1990s, there was a radical departure in the government's cultural industry policy, from that of political control over the cultural industries to viewing them as central to the government's export-focused economic development strategies. The policy of developing the cultural industries was implemented in conjunction with government investment in other strategic industries, such as the information and communication technology industries. In the 2000s, the domestic market for cultural products expanded and diversified rapidly as the Korean society enjoyed improved living standards and a growing middle class demanded improved quality from Korea's cultural products. The rapid development of other industries also facilitated the enhanced competitiveness of Korean cultural products in global markets. As a result, Korea's cultural industries made substantial inroads into East-Asian markets in the late 1990s and into global markets in the 2000s.","[Kwon, Seung-Ho] Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kim, Joseph] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kwon, SH (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",s.kwon@unsw.edu.au,,"Kim, Joseph/0000-0002-5521-8213",,,,,90,72,87,3,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

How can we reach the archetypal sphere of both cultures? We intended to find out the archetypes dominating a given culture, as well as the ways the subjects experienced reality and functioned within it. We also aimed to discover the meanings that might be hidden behind the symbolic representation of archetypes present in a given culture. We were particularly interested in the influences of the Great Mother and Wise Old Man archetypes in the process of individuation in the research subjects, who served as representatives of the given cultures. A total of 140 subjects took part in our research. We applied our own projective method, which consisted of a set of eighteen colorful pictures representing six main archetypes described by C. G.

This paper examines two groups of expatriate Koreans in Hanoi-skilled/managerial workers and the Korean small-business workers. The high concentration of expatriate workers in Hanoi has given rise to the Korean ethnic enclave of My Dinh, many of whose establishments are owned, managed, and serviced by Koreans. The easy availability of services offered by these businesses enables a culture-based support of Korean expatriates in a new city, and the reproduction of Korean life through consumption. Our paper contributes to the literature on the ethnic economy by identifying the nature of customer support for Korean ethnic enterprises. By highlighting the Korean-owned-and-managed small business character of the urban ethnic economy, we demonstrate the importance of consumption in allowing Korean ways of life to be maintained in a new city.

Using job satisfaction as a mediator, this study aims to examine an indirect influence of organizational justice on police officers' commitment to their organization. Design/methodology/approach - This study employed a survey of 418 police officers in South Korea while on in-service training. In exploring the complex relationship among organizational justice (i.e. distributive, procedural, and interactional), job satisfaction, and organizational commitment, the researchers utilized structural equation modeling to overcome the weaknesses of linear regression models. Findings - Officers' perception of organizational justice was positively related with their level of organizational commitment. In addition, perception of procedural and interactional justice had an indirect impact on the officers' organizational commitment through distributive justice. Lastly, perception of organizational justice showed an indirect influence on organizational commitment through job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - Due to its cross-sectional design, the findings do not confirm any causal relationship among the variables. In addition, the current study used a purposive sample of police officers in South Korea, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by examining organizational commitment in light of officers' perception of organizational justice and job satisfaction using structural equation modeling to explore the complex relationship among the organizational factors.","[Crow, Matthew M.; Lee, Chang-Bae] Univ W Florida, Sch Justice Studies & Social Work, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA; [Joo, Jae-Jin] Honam Univ, Dept Police Law & Publ Adm, Gwangiu, South Korea",State University System of Florida; University of West Florida; Honam University,"Lee, CB (corresponding author), Univ W Florida, Sch Justice Studies & Social Work, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",clee@uwf.edu,"Crow, Matthew/A-4528-2013",,,,,,107,77,106,1,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-951X,1758-695X,,POLICING,Policing-An Int J Police Strategies & Manag.,,2012,35,2,,,,,402,423,,10.1108/13639511211230156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13639511211230156,,,22,Criminology & Penology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Criminology & Penology,966ZC,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000305874900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Firstly, there is a US-China power transition, reflecting China's emergence as an economic and military power in Northeast Asia. This is challenging US regional dominance. The second transition reflects South Korea's development of an independent defence capability against North Korea. A consensus has emerged among Chinese scholars and analysts in government think tanks that these two trends have encouraged South Korea to place itself at greater distance from the United States and China, and to pursue an independent policy toward North Korea that supports Chinese policy preferences. Chinese understanding of the dual power transition is reflected in Beijing's policies toward South Korea, North Korea and denuclearisation. China no longer contributes to North Korea's diplomatic isolation or to sanctions regimes against it, with implications for US policy.","[Ross, Robert S.] Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Ross, Robert S.] Harvard Univ, John King Fairbank Ctr Chinese Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston College; Harvard University,"Ross, RS (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.;Ross, RS (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John King Fairbank Ctr Chinese Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,126,4,4,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-6338,1468-2699,,SURVIVAL,Survival,NOV 2,2021,63,6,,,,,129,158,,10.1080/00396338.2021.2006455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2021.2006455,,,30,International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations; Government & Law,XD5JD,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000722744200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the West Sea of Korea has spring tides ranging from 3 to 9 metres high, fishermen in this area are highly attuned to tidal changes. Based on ethnographic research at a fishing village on the West Sea, this paper reviews the traditional knowledge of Korean fishermen about tide and time, categorised by the concept of multtae (tide time). I develop the argument in three parts. First, I describe what multtae is, and by what time units the tidal changes are measured. Second, I explain the principles and the folk classification of the 15-day tidal cycle by analysing the native terminology of multtae. Third, I define the unique life of the fishermen both at sea and on land who rely on the tide as 'multtae life,' and describe how the knowledge of multtae is used in their daily life. The fishermen's cognitive system of multtae focuses on the sari (spring tides) and the jogeum (neap tides), with more emphasis on the sari. The fishermen's traditional knowledge of multtae provides a good example of intangible cultural heritage by showing how systematically a natural phenomenon can be recognised and become a part of local culture.","[Jo, Sook-Jeong] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Ctr Intangible Culture Studies, Jeonju, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University,"Jo, SJ (corresponding author), Chonbuk Natl Univ, Ctr Intangible Culture Studies, Jeonju, South Korea.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,NATL FOLK MUSEUM KOREA-NFMK,JONGNO-GU,"SAMCHEONGDONG-GIL 35, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1975-3586,1975-4019,,INT J INTANG HERIT,Int.

As observed, the measures brought economic turmoil rather than prosperity. Intrinsically, North Korea has been hostile toward market-oriented reform. However, with the consistent economic difficulties, the tight grip of the present government is in fact gradually loosening; corruption seems to be out of control and private business is starting to prevail. It is still arguable that the expansion of markets and emerging entrepreneurship has fundamentally altered the skewed North Korean economy. However, the repressive stance taken by the North Korean government does not allow its citizens to engage in independent economic activities that might compromise the stability of the regime. Without a further reform, it seems unlikely that the North Korean economy can make any meaningful progress in the near future.","Sejong Inst, Songnam 461370, South Korea",,"Yang, UC (corresponding author), Sejong Inst, 400 Daewang Pangyo Ro, Songnam 461370, South Korea.",ucyang@sejong.org,,,,,,,36,18,18,0,8,"MCFARLAND & COMPANY, INC, PUBLISHERS",JEFFERSON,"BOX 611, JEFFERSON, NC 28640 USA",1551-2789,,,N KOREAN REV,North Korean Rev.,SPR,2010,6,1,,,,,71,87,,10.3172/NKR.6.1.71,http://dx.doi.org/10.3172/NKR.6.1.71,,,17,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,587IZ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000276985900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Importantly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Korean medicine (KM) and Western medicine (WM) in medical service use. The general characteristics and the frequency of utilization of medical services were analyzed for 18,130 participants. Chisquare analysis was used to examine the factors that affected medical service use. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the odds ratio (OR) between the KM Use with WM Use and KM&WM Use with disease group. The proportion of respondents who used KM&WM was the highest among those over 65 years of age and it was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). The OR for using KM and WM was 3.236 and it was also statistically significant (p < 0.001). Further, the ORs of KM&WM Use for all seven disease groups were greater than 1 and were statistically significant (p < 0.001) except for respiratory disease. The significant ORs of KM&WM Use were 10.342 (musculoskeletal), 2.073 (exogenous causes), 1.988 (nervous), 1.677 (digestive), 1.541 (circulatory) and 1.386 (skin). The findings in this study were attributed to a combination of social aspects such as the increasing incidence of chronic diseases among the elderly population, policy aspects such as the collaborative pilot project to promote collaborative treatment (CT), economic aspects, such as a lower total cost for CT and scientific aspects such as evidence supporting the efficacy of CT.","[Choi, Young-eun] Korea Inst Oriental Med, Clin Res Coordinating Team, Daejeon 34054, South Korea; [Choi, Young-eun] Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Korean Med, Pusan 50612, South Korea; [Kim, Chul-woung] Chungnam Natl Univ, Coll Med, Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Prevent Med, Daejeon 35015, South Korea",Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM); Pusan National University; Chungnam National University,"Kim, CW (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Coll Med, Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Prevent Med, Daejeon 35015, South Korea.",woung@cnu.ac.kr,"; Kim, Chul-Woung/KVZ-1677-2024","Choi, Youngeun/0000-0001-6915-3716; Kim, Chul-Woung/0000-0002-1958-6000",Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine [KSN2022210],Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine,This work is supported by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KSN2022210).,,29,5,5,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9032,,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,SEP,2022,10,9,,,,,,,1697,10.3390/healthcare10091697,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091697,,,12,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,4U5GD,36141308,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000858821100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea. Methods Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression. Results The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: beta = 0.419, S. E = 0.164,p = 0.0105; high: beta = 0.476, S. E = 0.178,p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: beta = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250,p = 0.7555; high: beta = 0.003, S. E = 0.215,p = 0.9882). Conclusions These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.","[Oh, Byeong Cheol; Yeon, Ji-Yoon; Lee, Hyo-Sang] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Med Courses, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Doo Woong] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Publ Hlth, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Lee, Doo Woong; Park, Eun-Cheol] Yonsei Univ, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Eun-Cheol] Yonsei Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Park, Eun-Cheol] Yonsei Univ, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Coll Med, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Lee, DW (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Publ Hlth, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.;Lee, DW; Park, EC (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Seoul, South Korea.;Park, EC (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.;Park, EC (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Coll Med, 50-1 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",doowoonglee@yuhs.ac; ecpark@yuhs.ac,"Lee, Doo Woong/IAL-9314-2023","LEE, DOO WOONG/0000-0002-8843-2099; Park, Eun-Cheol/0000-0002-2306-5398",,,,,53,2,3,0,16,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2458,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,JUN 20,2020,20,1,,,,,,,972,10.1186/s12889-020-09058-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09058-w,,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",ME8NJ,32563266,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000544909700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

About 94,000 Koreans in Japan were repatriated to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, but stories of these individuals after their repatriation are largely unknown due to the tightly controlled information about their lives in North Korea and the complex geopolitical relations among South Korea, North Korea and Japan. The repatriates and their families' experience of separation and multiple displacements is a historical disaster borne of Japanese colonialism and the Cold War. Yang's autobiographical films visualise the silenced suffering of repatriates in a poignant handling of space, objects and sound that articulates their affective reaction to their homeland. Yang's works thus make two important contributions to our understanding of the historical disaster: they highlight the ambiguity of the homeland for the repatriates while functioning as a cinematic testimony to the silenced suffering of the repatriates and their families.","[Rhee, Jooyeon] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Rhee, J (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jxr5820@psu.edu,,,Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2018-OLU-2250001],"Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2018-OLU-2250001).,,44,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

Data were gathered through a survey, followed by semi-structured interviews from 21 secondary school students studying at an alternative school specifically designed for North Korean refugees in the Seoul-metropolitan area to explore their experiences in North Korea and the alternative school, and about their perspectives on how this new educational environment has affected their educational attitudes, satisfaction, and behavior. The students reported that the changes they experienced in educational objectives and focus at the South Korean alternative school positively impacted their educational attitudes, led to feelings of greater satisfaction with their education, and led to increases in their work ethic and focus on study. The results of the study suggest that an educational system that provides North Korean refugees with freedom and support to develop personal skills and knowledge to pursue their aspirations or goals can have positive impacts on the way they view education and the satisfaction they feel from it, which can lead to positive changes in their educational behavior.","[Jones, Aaron G.] Dallas Baptist Univ, Dallas, TX 75211 USA; [Whitehead, George E.

As North Korea itself was born out of the Soviet occupation zone, the USSR exercised a strong influence and the Korean People's Army was largely shaped in the Soviet image. The author analyses North Korean military regulations, unit structure, ranks, the political officer system and Party organisations in the army. The article's findings are that the KPA was moulded according to the Soviet model, borrowing elements of its structure from different eras of Soviet history, including those that predated the creation of the North Korean state. Although some elements of its Soviet origin disappeared over time, it would not be an exaggeration to say the North Korean army is still a Soviet-type one.","[Tertitskiy, Fyodor] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Tertitskiy, F (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, Seoul, South Korea.",fyodor.tertitskiy@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,2,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2017,20,1,,,,,195,219,,10.18399/acta.2017.20.1.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2017.20.1.009,,,25,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,FI2AD,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000411737700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

After a general introductory section, in which the worldwide literary archetype of the hero and its evolution over time are examined, the author, specifically examining Korean literature, analyzes in part one the passive heroes of four short historical/mythological stories variously set in an era between the second and eighth centuries, and then part two of the article analyzes three passive hero figures as protagonists of one 14th-century tale and two 18th-century classic novels. The author thus shows how the narrative of the passive hero has undergone a significant transformation in Korea, passing from a mythical/spiritual state (which often does not even admit the figure of an antagonist) to a decidedly secular, materialist and politicized condition where the protagonists find themselves facing cultural superstructures which, in addition to generating antagonists, push passive heroes towards true forms of defensive fundamentalism.","[Riotto, Maurizio] Anyang Univ, Fac Theol, Anyang, South Korea",Anyang University,"Riotto, M (corresponding author), Anyang Univ, Fac Theol, Anyang, South Korea.",lugalbanda@anyang.ac.kr,,,Humanities Korea Plus Project through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF- 2019S1A6A3A03058791],"Humanities Korea Plus Project through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Humanities Korea Plus Project through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF- 2019S1A6A3A03058791) .,,71,0,0,1,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1588-2667,0001-6446,,ACTA ORIENT ACAD SCI,Acta Orient.

Not only does the Korean Wave reiterate notions of older traditions, but it also constructs a new one in terms of bastardy. Tellingly, many Korean television dramas revolve around protagonists of lowly origin caught in the hierarchy of premodern Korea. In the case of recent art-house and certain popular films, we are witnessing a transgressiveness that swings to both ends of the pendulum, from tradition to bastardy. Tradition lives in the fear of the symbolic bastards who might usurp power, such as through the contamination of the bloodline through incest. Yet, as a result of foreign invasions and suffering, the hermit Kingdom resembles a circle that tries to keep itself intact, impervious to outside forces. Translated into the Korean Wave's domestic television drama, this drive inward turns into the tease of forbidden love, usually between lovers who mistake each other for half-sibling, such as in Winter Sonata. Not until the bastard art house film Old Boy does the traditional tease of incest dare to manifest itself nakedly. Indeed, even that which causes pain in the Korean consciousness is not instinctively demonized as the Other. Rather, it is internalized, opposite in valence to the Western tendency of outward projection. This duality of tradition and/of bastardy in the Korean Wave attracts Asian audiences all around the globe, which find themselves ambivalently wedged between a lost tradition and a modernity of the Other.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Ma, SM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mash@msu.edu,"Ma, Shengmei/LJL-5099-2024",,,,,,12,3,5,0,7,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,FAL,2006,46,3,,,,,132,153,,,,,,22,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,106OR,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000242110800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reduced access to health-related information is one reason for gaps in knowledge and the widening health disparities among minority populations. However, little research exists about KAs' health information seeking behaviors. Guided by the Structural Influence Model, this study examines the influence of immigration status on KAs' trust in health information sources and health information seeking behaviors. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area as well as in the Gwangju metropolitan city in South Korea during 2006-2007. Two hundred and fifty-four KAs and 208 native Koreans who were 40 years of age or older completed the surveys. When comparing native Koreans to KAs, we found KAs were 3 times more likely to trust health information from newspapers or magazines (odds ratio [OR] = 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49-6.54) and 11 times more likely to read the health sections of newspapers or magazines (OR = 11.35; 95% CI = 3.92-32.91) in multivariate adjusted models. However, they were less likely to look for health information from TV (OR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.12-0.72) than native Koreans. Our results indicate that immigration status has profound influences on KAs' health information seeking behaviors. Increasing the availability of reliable and valid health information from printed Korean language magazines or newspapers could have a positive influence on increasing awareness and promoting screening behaviors among KAs.","[Oh, Kyeung Mi; Kreps, Gary; Kim, Wonsun] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Zhou, Qiuping (Pearl)] George Washington Univ, Ashburn, VA USA",George Mason University; George Washington University,"Oh, KM (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Nursing, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",koh5@gmu.edu,"; Kreps, Gary/F-7903-2013","Oh, Kyeung Mi/0000-0001-8199-0306; Kreps, Gary/0000-0001-5980-129X; Kim, Sunny Wonsun/0000-0002-2926-2712",,,,,82,35,45,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1090-1981,1552-6127,,HEALTH EDUC BEHAV,Health Educ.

As a prominent case of media globalization, the rise of the Korean Wave in a global context initiated the exploration of Korean Americans' imagination of attractiveness. Noting that white standardized body images have spread along with mass-mediated content, this paper questions whether this new media environment brought with it a similar shift in perceptions of attractiveness. Employing the concepts of intersectionality and Appadurai's notion of global imagination, the researcher delved into the daily lives and media practices of Korean Americans during ten months of fieldwork in the Philadelphia area and conducted in-depth interviews with about thirty Korean Americans. Transnational media became emancipative resources for their global imagination, embracing their ethnic identity. Yet, young Korean American women in particular actively engaged in consumerism driven by global capitalism, as well as Western-centered beauty standards and fashion trends, via mediated images in Korean media.

Our research questions are threefold; first, how do these immigrants from the divided Korea perceive the division and unification of Germany? Second, did the fact that the division of Germany could be overcome affect their views on the division and unification of the Korean Peninsula? Third, are there any differences between Koreans in Germany and Koreans in Korea with respect to their views on unification? Our research suggests that different from South Korea, where the discourses in the media and the academia tend to assume sharply antagonistic attitudes, discourses among Koreans in Germany are generally much more supportive of unification. This is because they have a positive perception of German unification in everyday life and, furthermore, have constructed for themselves a future-oriented identity as a people of the Korean Peninsula that will eventually be unified. Korean immigrants in Germany are considerably more optimistic about the possibility of Korean unification than people in South Korea.","[Jung, Jin-Heon] Max Planck Inst Study Religious & Ethn Divers, Hermann Foge Weg 11, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Lee, Eun-Jeung] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Korean Studies, Dept Hist & Cultural Studies, Otto von Simson Str 11, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Max Planck Society; Free University of Berlin,"Jung, JH (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Study Religious & Ethn Divers, Hermann Foge Weg 11, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jung@mmg.mpg.de; Eun-Jeunglee@fu-berlin.de,"JEONG, JIN-HEON/O-3734-2017",,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2017S1A3A2065782],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2017S1A3A2065782).,,15,1,1,0,5,GESIS LEIBNIZ INST SOCIAL SCIENCES,COLOGNE,"UNTER SACHSENHAUSEN 6-8, COLOGNE, D-50667, GERMANY",0172-6404,,,HIST SOC RES,Hist.

J,"Yu, J",,,,"Yu, John",,,"Bilingual, Intergenerational Worship and Ministry for Unity",RELIGIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,bilingual; intergenerational; Korean; Korean American; worship; spiritual identity,,"Many Korean American churches have several different worship services on a given Sunday that cater to different age and language groups. The intent is to cater to the different needs of each group, where each group can worship in an age-appropriate setting with the language they are comfortable with. However, it has also had the unintended consequence of creating factions and divisions within the church. It is not uncommon to hear about conflicts and quarrels between Korean Ministry (KM) and English Ministry (EM), from the leadership level down to the congregation members. While there may be several other contributing factors to church conflicts, one key reason is worshipping separately, which creates different spiritual identities within the church. This article proposes that through a creative and engaging bilingual, intergenerational worship and ministry, different generations in Korean American churches, and perhaps other immigrant churches in multilingual and multicultural settings, can worship and learn together as one community with a common spiritual identity. Careful planning of liturgy that is meaningful to different age and language groups is the key. A project conducted at True Light Community Church, a Korean American congregation in the Metro-Denver area, shows that different generations can be brought together in unity as they worship together regularly. In this project, basic qualitative research tools were used to plan a six-month worship and ministry program. The results show that while it is difficult to provide a meaningful, spiritual experience for every single person or generation, bilingual, intergenerational worship and ministry can bring different generations together.","[Yu, John] True Light Community Church, Aurora, CO 80013 USA",,"Yu, J (corresponding author), True Light Community Church, Aurora, CO 80013 USA.",jihoon526@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,APR,2022,13,4,,,,,,,287,10.3390/rel13040287,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel13040287,,,10,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,0S2YQ,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000786145400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In April 2007, the perpetrator of the shooting incident on the Virginia Tech University campus was identified as a person who emigrated to the USA from Korea at a young age. The current study compared non-Korean Americans, Korean Americans, Koreans in the USA, and Koreans in Korea in terms of their attributions and emotions concerning the perpetrator and the shooting incident. Participants were asked to indicate (1) the extent to which they attributed the cause of the incident to either American society or the perpetrator, (2) their emotions (e.g., upset), and (3) the extent to which they categorized the perpetrator as an American, a Korean American, or a Korean. The results indicated that non-Korean Americans were most likely to attribute the cause of the incident to the perpetrator as opposed to American society. Non-Korean Americans, Korean Americans, and Koreans in the United States had more negative emotions (e.g., unhappy, sad, and upset) about the incident than Koreans in Korea did. The results also indicated that individuals differed in their attributions and emotions depending on how they categorized the perpetrator. For example, categorizing the perpetrator as being a Korean was positively related to Americans' tendency to hold the perpetrator responsible, while categorizing the perpetrator as being an American was negatively related to the tendency to hold the perpetrator responsible among Koreans in Korea. The findings may imply that social identity theory, intergroup emotion theory, and cultural orientations (e.g., individualism and collectivism) can provide insights into people's reactions to a tragic incident.","[Park, Hee Sun] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yun, Doshik] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Commun, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Choi, Hye Jeong] Penn State Univ, Dept Commun Arts & Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Hye Eun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Communicol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lee, Dong Wook] Jeju Natl Univ, Marine & Environm Res Inst, Cheju, South Korea; [Ahn, Jiyoung] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Michigan State University; Western Illinois University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Jeju National University; Chung Ang University,"Park, HS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, 481 CAS, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",heesun@msu.edu,"; Lee, Hye/W-7726-2019; ahn, jiyoung/KSM-2201-2024; Choi, Hyejeong/HJP-9451-2023","Choi, Hye Jeong/0000-0003-0996-0713; Lee, Hye Eun/0000-0002-7043-3640; Park, Hee Sun/0000-0002-5389-8673;",,,,,34,4,8,0,38,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0020-7594,1464-066X,,INT J PSYCHOL,Int.

The mindset sedimented in South Korean archaeologists is that all groups and polities in prehistoric and proto-historic Korea must be incorporated into a unilinear evolutionary stage model as a single people. Since 1945, South Korean archaeologists have endeavoured to establish the ethnic origin of this people, along with the timeline of Korean prehistory in order to reconstruct the unilinear independent history of the homogenous nation. By adopting periodization systems created in Western archaeology-such as the Three Age System and neo-evolutionism-leading South Korean archaeologists have attempted to objectify their irrational ideological idea of homogeneity and a unilinear evolutionary process. Even today, periodization itself is a very important issue in Korea, because it is not easy to combine the internal development pattern with the impact of external cultural traits diffused from China and incorporate various contemporary groups with different development levels into a single stage. These issues cause severe disputes; South Korean archaeologists, however, fail to offer an adequate solution, instead deepening the contradictions entailed in a unified timeline model, because they cannot change the fundamental premise of South Korean archaeology, namely the homogenous Korean nation formed in the Bronze Age. Moreover, these disputes rather prevent the application of a multi-evolutionary process model based on the political economy approach to the prehistoric and ancient Korean cases.","[Park, Hae Woon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea; [Wee, Kaya] Sunkyunkwan Univ Museum, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Park, HW (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea.",haewoon.park@gmail.com,,,,,,,86,4,5,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1555-8622,1935-3987,,ARCHAEOLOGIES,Archaeologies-J.

These moves began in earnest from the 1980s to analyze the dynamic development process of Korean studies. The periods analyzed as part of this study were marked by two dramatic transitions in academic trends. The first was that of the 1980s to the mid-1990s, a period in which a huge epistemological transition took place in the nationalism and internal development-based paradigm of historical studies, as well as in the developmentalism and modernization paradigm of social sciences. The second transition took place in the late 1990s, in which cultural approaches to history challenged traditional methods, and new paradigms based on postmodernity, postnationalism, and postcolonialism emerged. This study analyzes the academic activities and journals of two organizations that have continuously played a major role in informing the direction of modern and contemporary Korean history since the 1980s, namely the Korean Social History Association and the Institute for Korean Historical Studies.","Kwangwoon Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea",Kwangwoon University,"Kim, BY (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",kimby@kw.ac.kr,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,1,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,FAL,2011,51,3,,,,,104,139,,,,,,36,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,836PG,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000296123000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Research finds that South Koreans prefer co-ethnic migrants from culturally similar or desirable origins, but it says little about the integration of migrant groups. Existing data and qualitative studies suggest considerable barriers to fully incorporating otherwise preferred migrants. Focusing on integrating North Korean migrants in South Korea - a relatively privileged migrant group that enjoys substantial resettlement support but encounters barriers to full integration - this paper addresses the research gap by testing competing explanations of migrant incorporation. Informed by Intergroup Threat Theory (ITT), the study examines how threats defined as realistic or symbolic shape native attitudes toward these migrants. Using a conjoint survey experiment to measure preferences for economic, political, and social integration, we find South Koreans favor North Korean migrants with extended residence in South Korea, which is a marker for diminishing realistic and symbolic intergroup threats. Conversely, migrants signaling stronger affiliations to North Korea or lacking diverse social ties in South Korea fail to alleviate intergroup threat concerns and consequently face discrimination. Our findings offer insights into integration policy and contribute to the migration and citizenship literature and contemporary Korean Studies.","[Denney, Steven; Green, Christopher] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Denney, S (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",s.c.denney@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,"Denney, Steven/0000-0002-6542-1055; Green, Christopher/0000-0003-2025-7631",Academy of Korean Studies,Academy of Korean Studies,No Statement Available,,93,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-183X,1469-9451,,J ETHN MIGR STUD,J.

Data gathered from 951 Taiwanese and 949 Philippine survey respondents were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM), in which 13 of the hypothesized 16 direct, mediating, and moderating relationships were supported. This research demonstrates how, through appropriate theoretical lenses supported by empirically tested data, production-based factors of visual and audio components can sway favorable attitudes and preferences under customer-based contextual factors, including peer pressure, self-efficacy, and media. This guides producers to appreciate cultural nuances affecting KPop's global popularity, and the importance of deciding the product mix strategies best suited for different markets.","[Ryu, Jungyop] Yonhap News Agcy, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Jungyop] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan; [Capistrano, Erik Paolo] Univ Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines; [Lin, Hao-Chieh] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Capistrano, EP (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Cesar EA Virata Sch Business, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",escapistrano@up.edu.ph,"Capistrano, Erik/AAO-3633-2021; Hao-Chieh, Lin/IXN-0588-2023","Capistrano, Erik Paolo/0000-0001-8122-5452",,,,,54,9,9,8,144,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1470-7853,2515-2173,,INT J MARKET RES,Int.

J,"Ancuta, K",,,,"Ancuta, Katarzyna",,,B is for Baempaieo: the rise of K-vampires,CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vampire; Korean drama; fox spirits; Korean Neo-Confucianism,,"This article discusses the construction of K-vampires in popular Korean television dramas, focusing on three series that feature central vampire characters: Vampire Prosecutor, a crime procedural running for two seasons in 2011 and 2012, its spin-off, Vampire Detective and a medical drama Blood. The main protagonists in these series are all simultaneously vampires and members of professions designed to help humans: a lawyer, a detective and a surgeon. Constructed as parallel to humans, the vampires are portrayed as free-willed individuals striving to overcome their condition. The article argues that the humanization of K-vampires can be seen as a hybridization strategy blending the characterization of the 'reluctant' vampires known from Western post-millennial fiction with some features of the Korean kumiho, a supernatural shape-shifting fox creature that desires to become human. The article also proposes to read the series in the Neo-Confucian context, particularly in relation to its social and gender norms. It argues that while the male vampires in the series function chiefly to deliver critique of Korean neoliberal society, with the heroes modelled on the virtuous seonbi scholars and the villains described as sociopathic capitalists, the female vampires are mostly portrayed as tragic heroines, vilified for their moral transgressions and redeemed through selfless sacrifice.","[Ancuta, Katarzyna] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Arts, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Ancuta, K (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Arts, Bangkok, Thailand.",kancuta@gmail.com,,"Ancuta, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0035-8374",,,,,32,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-4312,1469-3666,,CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU,Continuum-J.

The following multiple-choice questions were asked: one's general ideas about the integration of North and South Korea; the type of Korean reunification which is mostly supported/opposed; the type of Korean reunification which is most probable; and the pros and cons of reunification as well as necessary factors for reunification. Furthermore, we examined the differences in the perception of Korean reunification among the subgroup based on participants' demographic information (i.e., gender, age, political orientation). The main results are as follows. First, the most representative thought on integration was geographical integration of the Korean Peninsula, followed by establishment of economic partnerships or communities and restoration of common identity. Meanwhile, there were differences among participants with regard to the detailed representation of Korean reunification. It suggests that when the attitudes toward integration of North and South Korea society are discussed, differences in the perception among people should be considered.","[Lee, Woo-Young; Lee, Hayeon] Univ North Korean Studies, 2,Bukchon Ro 15 Gil, Seoul 03053, South Korea",,"Lee, WY (corresponding author), Univ North Korean Studies, 2,Bukchon Ro 15 Gil, Seoul 03053, South Korea.",wylee@kyungnam.ac.kr; hylee@kyungnam.ac.kr,,"Lee, Hayeon/0000-0002-2155-9247",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2017S1A3A2065782],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2017S1A3A2065782).

This article explains the sociohistorical and theoretical implications of YDP-UIM under the supervision of the Presbyterian Church of Korea into the following three aspects. First, many democratic labor unions supported or led by YDP-UIM played a significant role historically in establishing the Korean Federation of Trade Unions. Second, credit unions introduced to the GIC by YDP-UIM saw unexpected success in protecting GIC industrial workers from falling prey to institutionalized usurers, and the National Credit Union Federation of Korea has grown today to become the world's third largest credit union federation. In-depth interviews with YDP-UIM's leading activists, however, repeatedly reveal that their practical innovation was the result of their self-reflective interaction with industrial workers alienated from religion itself as well from established society. Finally, these interviews point out how and why the positive relationship between religious innovation and free competition posited by religious market theorists should be revised, both theoretically and empirically, in the Korean context.","[Yoo, Kwangsuk] Kyung Hee Univ, Sociol, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, K (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Sociol, Seoul, South Korea.",ksyooii@khu.ac.kr,,"Yoo, Kwang Suk/0000-0001-6427-9547",National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046920]; John Templeton Foundation,"National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); John Templeton Foundation","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea (NRF-2015S1A3A2046920), as well as by the John Templeton Foundation.",,52,1,1,0,3,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2017,57,4,,,,,98,117,,,,,,20,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,FR3ZA,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000419004100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new approach with a midterm goal of peaceful coexistence is needed to keep Pyongyang positively engaged and to set the stage for eventual reunification and denuclearization. While Washington may take the lead in dealing with the nuclear issue, Seoul must take the lead in Korean Peninsula reunification. The U. S. and ROK must agree upon and then jointly articulate their respective roles and missions and begin making the case today for a role for the alliance post-reunification.

Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected in 2009 at the Korean National Police University (KNPU) and the Police Comprehensive Academy (PCA). The questionnaires distributed to police officers contained 14 vignettes describing various forms of police-misconduct. The sample consists of 329 police officers, mostly non-supervisors, attending courses at the KNPU and PCA. Findings - Results indicate that the contours of police integrity vary across different forms of misconduct. Regardless of whether the respondents' views were measured through questions about misconduct seriousness, appropriate discipline, willingness to report, or knowledge about official rules, the findings suggest that Korean police officers perceived corruption as a serious form of police misconduct, while they considered the use of excessive force to be substantially less serious. In addition, a strong code of silence among the police was detected. Research limitations/implications - The study examines the contours of police integrity among a convenience sample of police officers from South Korea. Practical implications - The Korean police administrators interested in controlling police misconduct could utilize this methodology to explore the contours of the code of silence among the Korean police. The results of the study indicate that substantial focus should be put on changing police officer views about the use of excessive force and narrowing the code of silence in general. Social implications - The results show that the contours of police integrity among South Korean police officers clearly reflect the attitudes and views of the society at large toward corruption and use of excessive force. The lenient attitudes that South Korean police officers have expressed regarding the use of excessive force reflect both the historical attitudes and the lack of clarity of official rules. The strong code of silence is related to the insufficient protection for whistleblowers and the adherence to Confucianism among Korean citizens. Originality/value - Prior research predominantly measured police integrity as the opposite of police corruption in Western democracies and East European countries in transition. This research expands this by focusing on different forms of police misconduct. In addition, it explores integrity in an Asian democracy with the police agency undergoing extensive reform.","[Ivkovic, Sanja Kutnjak] Michigan State Univ, Sch Criminal Justice, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kang, Wook] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Edmond, OK USA",Michigan State University; University of Central Oklahoma,"Ivkovic, SK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Sch Criminal Justice, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kutnjak@msu.edu,"; Ivkovich, Sanja/L-9197-2019","Kutnjak Ivkovich, Sanja/0000-0003-0709-5404;",,,,,58,20,30,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-951X,,,POLICING,Policing-An Int J Police Strategies & Manag.,,2012,35,1,,,,,76,103,,10.1108/13639511211215469,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13639511211215469,,,28,Criminology & Penology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Criminology & Penology,921NX,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000302485400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

By examining media control by the government authorities in both late Choson Korea and late imperial China, this study aims to examine how the state and policymakers attempted to control the flow of unorthodox books and how the production of books epitomized the cultural values of the day. What value system prompted the authorities to forbid a certain body of texts? What agencies were instrumental in the circulation of books? By analyzing various travelogues to Beijing (yonhaengnok) and notes on poetry (sihwa), this article examines how the transnational interaction between China and Korea and changing textual environments influenced the production of literature in late Choson. Using a specific case study of Yi Tong-mu (1741-1793), this article demonstrates that various informal networks outside of conventional channels functioned as the actual key drivers of book culture. In particular, a number of book brokers in the Qing and Choson facilitated the distribution of forbidden books. My study on these circulatory dynamics reveals how negotiations between the control of media and the distributing of books influenced the textual environments and how the cultural value system shaped the production of literature.","[Yoo, Jamie Jungmin] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yoo, JJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",crimsonyoo@post.harvard.edu,"Yoo, Jamie/JSK-9330-2023",,,,,,36,5,5,0,1,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2017,20,1,,,,,249,280,,10.18399/acta.2017.20.1.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2017.20.1.011,,,32,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,FI2AD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000411737700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, Pyongyang declared that the byungjin line was successfully carried out and announced that the state will focus on economic construction. Nevertheless, the Kim Jong Un regime's credibility and resolve for denuclearization are the preconditions for peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula.

Design/methodology/approach - Culture influences management in significant ways. In order to understand true influences of culture on a country's economy and management, the paper looks at the dynamic interface between cultural forces and historical events that occurred in the country during the particular time period in point. It proposes that cultural forces and historical events are combined to form organizing principles in the country, which guide managers and workers in the economy to develop unique sets of work ethics: particular historical events reinforce or suppress particular elements of culture. Detailed case studies in Korea are used to support the proposition. Findings - Based on the case studies in Korea, the paper shows how the country's culture and modern history have been intertwined to form organizing principles, which in turn have influenced and guided the country's economic development and firm's management. Originality/value - This paper makes a rather unique contribution by suggesting an exploratory perspective that the dynamic interplay between cultural forces and historical events forms an economy's work ethics as organizing principles.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, B (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea.",bwkim@kaist.edu,"; Kim, Bowon/C-1550-2011","Kim, Bowon/0000-0002-5479-2977;",,,,,35,4,6,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0025-1747,1758-6070,,MANAGE DECIS,Manag.

J,"Huang, YY",,,,Huang Yong-yuan,,,Medicine of the Grassroots: Korean Herbal Medicine Industry and Consumption during the Japanese Colonial Period,KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Korean Herbal Medicine; Korean Herbal Medicine Industry; Traditional Korean Medicine; Korean Medicine Merchant; Chosun; Japanese Colonial Period; Consumption; Tradition; Medical Modernization,,"The colonial authorities' intention was to foster the advancement of Western medicine and phase out traditional Korean medicine. However, they merely imposed limitations on Uisaengs' operations-this policy loophole objectively left a window for Korean medicine merchants. Moreover, against the backdrop of the growing popularity of Western medicine and restrictions on the development of traditional Korean medicine by colonial authorities, the Korean herbal medicine industry, as one of the few national industries dominated by and serving Koreans, showed its tenacious vitality during that time. Korean medicine merchants responded to market changes with ease. They built different drugstores, such as traditional herbal stores mainly selling traditional Korean medicines, hybrid drugstores that simultaneously dealt with the manufacture and sale of patent medicines, and ginseng drugstores that specialized in the ginseng business. This classification promoted the commercialization of traditional Korean herbal medicine. Another crucial condition for the vitality of the Korean herbal medicine industry is Koreans' preference for traditional Korean medicine. It is an indisputable fact that Western medicine gradually became popular and was recognized by the common man during the colonial period; nonetheless, Eastern medicine and Western medicine were not playing a zero-sum game. Through comprehensive macro and micro analysis, this paper demonstrates that, during the colonial period, when old and new ideas interacted, most Koreans, including upper-class elites and intellectuals who were open-minded about emerging concepts and options and had ample opportunities to avail western medical treatment, preferred traditional Korean medicine. Using Korean herbal medicines for illnesses remained the primary choice, While Western medicine assumed the role of a supplement to traditional treatment. This paper argues that the first reason for this phenomenon is the inertia of tradition, and the second is that Western medicine was not necessarily more effective than Korean herbal medicine at that time. Specifically, it can be considered that, during the colonial period, the growing popularity of Western medicine failed to bring about a radical change in Koreans' regular medical interventions. Simultaneously, the Korean herbal medicine industry, one of the pillars offering medical support to the common man, adapted suitably while relying on the inertia of its own tradition. The industry's vitality and dynamism during the colonial period certainly underscore the need to amend the one-sided narrative of medical modernization vis-a-vis Western medicine.","[Huang Yong-yuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Korean Dept, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang Yong-yuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr East Asian Studies, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Huang, YY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Korean Dept, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Huang, YY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr East Asian Studies, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",ahuang412@sina.com,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"YONSEI UNIV COLL MED, DEPT MED HIST, 50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 03722, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

While the. foundation of the WPNK reflected Stalin's desire to unify leftist parties in North and South Korea, other domestic factors also facilitated its establishment, such as the necessity for unity among leftist forces and power struggles among local organizations of the Communist Party and the New Democratic Party. One of the goals of the merger was to create a popular vanguard party, rather than merely a united leftist one. The Party Programme did not specify a socialist direction and downplayed the unique ideology of the Communist Party. This tendency was strengthened by the increasing need for internal unity as violent confrontation developed between leftist and rightist forces when the United States and the Soviet Union occupied the Korean Peninsula. Only after its establishment, did the WPNK begin to expand its exclusive rights among political organizations in North Korea.","[Gong, Jinsung; Kee, Kwangseo] Chosun Univ, Gwangju, South Korea",Chosun University,"Kee, K (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, Gwangju, South Korea.",einfachjin@chosun.ac.kr; keeks@chosun.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,"ACAD EAST ASIAN STUD, SUNGKYUNKWAN UNIVERSITY",JONGNO-GU,"53 MYEONGNYUN-DONG 3-GA, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL 110-745, SOUTH KOREA",1598-2661,,,SUNGKYUN J EAST ASIA,Sungkyun J.

While existing studies have examined Korean Americans and zainichi as distinct groups, they often lack a comparative perspective that integrates these communities, particularly in the context of a shared colonial and postcolonial history. Furthermore, no research has yet analyzed Min Jin Lees' Free Food for Millionaires and Pachinko to explore how these novels address interconnected dimensions of Korean American and zainichi experiences. Through our textual analysis of Korean American and zainichi characters in her work, we explain spiritual, private, and public dimensions of conflict among members of the Korean diaspora. We discuss this conflict in two ways: first, as a reflection of generational gaps among members of the Korean diaspora, and second, as a survival mechanism for the Korean diaspora in the racially discriminatory context of the United States and the ethnically discriminatory context of Japan. Based on these analyses, we derive the concept of the Korean Pacific. This concept refers to the unique characteristics of members of the Korean diaspora who migrated and settled down when Japan and the United States ruled Korea as a colony and a postcolonial state, respectively, in the name of modernization.","[Lee, Joo Young; Chong, Ki-In] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Chong, Ki-In] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Chong, KI (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.;Chong, KI (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",jooylee@hufs.ac.kr; kiinchong@seoultech.ac.kr,,,,,,,33,0,0,2,2,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2025,65,1,,,,,177,203,,10.25024/kj.2025.65.1.177,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2025.65.1.177,,,27,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,1GC3V,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001464202700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The intense interactions between the Korean peninsula and Manchuria before 1945 often become subsumed into nationalist narratives of anti-Japanese resistance and the suffering of impoverished Korean migrants. While recent Korean historiography on Manchuria has addressed a broader array of historical issues, there is still much more research necessary to understand fully the position of Manchuria in modern Korean history. This study examines the postliberation narratives of Korean returnees from Manchuria during the immediate liberation period and reconnects their collective experiences with some key events of Korea and Manchuria under the Japanese empire. Through a discussion of the large scale Korean migration and economic integration that took place within Manchuria before 1945, the need for a broader historical paradigm becomes apparent. Colonial era historians developed their own historiographical models to explain the interconnections between the two regions. While the colonial historiography need not be rehabilitated for such purposes, there is still a need to conceptualize Manchuria and Korea from a transnational historical framework that can better elucidate the deep interconnections between the two regions before 1945.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",mkim@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Michael/U-4796-2018","Kim, Michael/0000-0003-2711-8132",,,,,72,6,9,0,7,KYUJANGGAK INST KOREAN STUD,"SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU","NO 103, SAN 56-1, SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0201,,,SEOUL J KOREAN STUD,Seoul J.

This article attempts to pin down some distinguishing features of South Korea's securitisation of the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, thereby investigating why one rarely sees the implications of securitisation theory in the way that the Copenhagen School theorists would suggest. Borrowing the key components of securitisation theory-existential threats, referent objects and extraordinary measures-this article suggests three elusive characteristics of the South Korean actors' speech acts as sources highlighting the dilemma. To make the article's arguments clearer, I hold Floyd's classification of securitisation theory, which separated the securitisation process into two different stages: securitising move and security practice. While acknowledging the importance of the differences between illocution and perlocution in a securitisation process, this article takes this logic one step further by suggesting the limits of the perlocutionary effect in making the securitisation process complete.","[Yoon, Seongwon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Yoon, S (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",visionysw@gmail.com,,"Yoon, Seongwon/0000-0003-4604-1353",,,,,86,3,3,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

J,"Jun, BK",,,,"Jun, Byoung-Kon",,,China's Sanctions on North Korea After Its Fourth Nuclear Test,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korea's nuclear test; sanctions against DPRK; Sino-DPRK relations; denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; US-Sino relations,,"This article aims to evaluate the will of the Chinese government to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2270 following North Korea's fourth nuclear test (1 January 2016), thereby seeking out the implications on China's sanctions against the DPRK after its fifth nuclear test (9 September 2016). The results of analysis in this article can be summed up as follows. First, the following instances capture the willingness of the Chinese government regarding the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK: (i) China agreed to stronger sanctions against North Korea (Resolution 2270); (ii) China boasted about its wholehearted support for - and complete willingness to implement - the sanctions at home and abroad; and (iii) upon the agreement, Beijing revealed the lists of items banned from export to North Korea and items subject to additional sanctions more promptly than before. Second, in spite of China's expressed willingness, the following instances demonstrate that there remain some limitations to Beijing's will regarding a thorough implementation of sanctions against Pyongyang: (i) the Chinese government argued that the United States should be responsible for sanctions against the North after its fourth nuclear test; (ii) China proposed the parallel approach of pursuing denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and a peace treaty; (iii) China placed an emphasis on improving the living conditions of North Koreans; and (iv) China expressed opposition to deployment of terminal high-altitude area defense on the Korean Peninsula. Third, such reactions are indicative of China's key essentials behind enforcing sanctions against the DPRK, which are the pursuit of Chinese national interests and the prevention of loss of those interests. To that end, China attempts to bypass the United States' monitoring and pressure, considers the growing strategic value of North Korea as a result of intensifying conflicts between the United States and China, and induces the DPRK into a realm of dialogue. The fact that China needs to secure influence over North Korea and maintain the North Korean regime in a stable state even after its fifth nuclear test indicates that its sanctions against North Korea will be implemented within a boundary of not causing the regime collapse or chaos.","[Jun, Byoung-Kon] Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Res Management Div, Seoul, South Korea",,"Jun, BK (corresponding author), Korea Inst Natl Unificat, Res Management Div, Seoul, South Korea.",jubykon@kinu.or.kr,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

If it does, then how significant has its influence been on the historical process of the conceptual formation of Korean's concept of war and peace? First learned over two millennia ago, Confucianism finally became the sole ruling ideology under the Joseon Dynasty. Ever since, Confucian virtues-moralistic approach, education of men, and family-like international order with the Middle Kingdom at the center, among many-played dominant roles in Korean domestic politics as well as its foreign relations (Sino-Korea relations, almost exclusively). What seemed to last forever in East Asia, however, confronted a massive challenge and the fate of Koreans was not an exception. Korea's bandwagoning strategy within the Confucian world order could not function any more with the advent of the age of imperialism and the subsequent foreign penetrations. The Japanese imperialism collapsed in 1945 and the American form of liberal democracy was transplanted in the new-born Republic of Korea in the beginning of the Cold War. Nevertheless, Koreans maintained the Confucian way of thinking and life that they had inherited over the past several centuries. And Confucianism, though largely implicit, continues to shape the concept of war and peace which again forms Koreans' view of international politics to date. This borne in mind, examining how Confucianism has constructed the Korean norms of international relations undoubtedly merits close attention of both scholars and policymakers in this age of post-Sunshine Policy in search of new foreign policy orientation.","Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Sung-Hack, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",koogo@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,16,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

The historical background for this was the frustration brought on by the inability of the Taehan Empire to defend itself effectively from the ongoing colonization by Japan. Culturally, nationalist individual terror was rooted in the Confucian respect towards those killing themselves in the name of humaneness (salsin song'in), but was also influenced by reports on the deeds of Russian, Polish and other nihilists that often appeared in the Korean press in the first decade of the twentieth century. The topic of this article is the reverse gaze-the perceptions of the Korean nationalist terror by Russian and, later, Soviet observers. That the Russian press outlets influenced by revolutionary radicals fully justified An Chunggun's 1909 assassination of Ito Hirobumi, was to be expected. However, even some conservative dailies also took An Chunggun's side, ascribing the assassination to the brutalities accompanying the Japanese colonization of Korea. A number of Maritime province-based news outlets, such as Priamurye, attempted a balanced, neutral approach of sorts. Given the lingering hostility towards Russia's erstwhile battlefield enemy, Japan, and the prevalence of individual terrorism inside Russia's own anti-autocracy struggle, the semi-sympathetic stance towards An Chunggun's shooting of Ito was perhaps natural. Similar attitudes towards Korean nationalist acts of individual terror continued further into the Soviet period: militant nationalists were expected to become Korean Communists' allies in the future.","[Tikhonov, Vladimir] Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Tikhonov, V (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",vladimir.tikhonov@ikos.uio.no,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,1,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2016,19,1,,,,,189,215,,10.18399/acta.2016.19.1.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2016.19.1.007,,,27,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,DP2BQ,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000378293500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although there have been many political challenges, the complex is still expected to reduce security concerns in the Korean peninsula by providing opportunities for North Korea to open doors to international society. In the field of law, the two Korean governments recognize the uniqueness of the KIC and have tried to establish legal tools for the complex. The complex is subject to certain inter-Korean agreements as well as laws and regulations established by the South and the North. The Korean governments also provide many types of support under inter-Korean agreements and national laws. Almost every South Korean PTA has preferential provisions to recognize KIC products as originating from South Korea, considering the special and unique relationship between the two Koreas. The laws for the KIC are open to change based on internal or external influences. To keep the special project running, however, laws need to be in line with principles to avoid political interferences. Better legal solutions can be found to improve the provisions of inter-Korean, domestic, and PTA laws with new industrial policies.","[Kim, Bongchul] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Ho] Amer Univ, Washington Coll Law, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; American University,"Kim, B (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",bong625@hufs.ac.kr; hufsho@hanmail.net,"Kim, Bongchul/AAT-4828-2020",,,,,,19,3,3,0,6,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2014,54,4,,,,,80,105,,,,,,26,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,AX8DU,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000347141400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In line with these studies, this article examines the relationship between personality traits - measured by the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) - and South Koreans' attitudes toward North Korea. The results from statistical analysis of two nationally representative surveys reveal that people who are conscientious are less likely to feel close to North Korea and more likely to believe North Korea is a hostile nation, whereas those high on Openness are more likely to harbour positive attitudes toward North Korea. Given that attitudes toward North Korea have been the most important determinant of political ideology in South Korea, these findings seem to be consistent with those of pre-existing studies.","CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Brooklyn College (CUNY),"Ha, SE (corresponding author), CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA.",sha@brooklyn.cuny.edu,"Ha, Shang/AAV-7179-2021",,,,,,30,5,6,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1834-4909,,,J PAC RIM PSYCHOL,J.

Over the past ten years, the notion of common strategic interests became a 'naturalized narrative' in Australia - a narrative, which through entrenched repetition becomes both natural and inevitable to such an extent that counter-narratives are seen as counterintuitive and open to ridicule.This study investigates the common strategic interests narrative. It first explores the bilateral relationship and the narrative gap that occurred during the president's visit. It then turns to the use of language and narrative in bilateral relationships. It looks at how the constituent components supporting the common strategic interests narrative are contextualized and how this impacts the political action of Australia and Korea.The study finds that the common strategic interests narrative does not cross the linguistic-cultural divide in the Australia-Korea bilateral relationship. The article concludes with policy recommendations. Australia needs to pay more attention to building policy relevance and education links in South Korea.","[Robertson, Jeffrey] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Robertson, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jsrobertson@junotane.com,"Robertson, Jeffrey/KHX-3166-2024",,Korea Foundation,Korea Foundation,This work was supported by Korea Foundation: [Grant Number Korea - Australia Relations Project].,,131,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7718,1465-332X,,AUST J INT AFF,Aust.

Through the lens of Allport's intergroup contact theory, the current study explored how SK college students' friendships with NK refugees influence their perspectives on (a) attitudes towards NK refugees; (b) interest in North Korea; and (c) views about Korean reunification. We used a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design that integrates quantitative data via a survey and qualitative data via in-depth interviews. Survey data drawn from 276 SK college students revealed that those with NK refugee friends showed more favourable attitudes towards the NK refugee population, greater interest in North Korea-related issues and NK society, and more positive perspectives on Korean reunification. A cross-analysis of in-depth interviews with 11 SK college students who developed friendships with NK refugees yielded five primary domains: (a) initial occasion on which they met the NK refugee friend(s); (b) feelings and thoughts about friendships with NK refugee(s); (c) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of the NK refugee population; (d) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of North Korea; and (e) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of Korean reunification. Based on the intergroup friendship's promising effects that our findings suggest, we discussed the benefits of employing educational practices that could promote intergroup contacts and understandings of North Korea and the refugee population.","[Lee, Ahlam] Xavier Univ, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA",University System of Ohio; Xavier University,"Lee, AH (corresponding author), Coll Profess Sci, Dept Leadership Studies & Human Resource Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45219 USA.",leea15@xavier.edu,,"Lee, Ahlam/0000-0001-8853-4768",,,,,64,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-1926,1469-3518,,BRIT EDUC RES J,Br.

Chai-Choon Kim and Jong-Sung Rhee were arguably most responsible for popularizing anti-missionary sentiment among Korean Christians. The main reason for the criticisms of both Kim and Rhee against the American Presbyterian Korea missionaries was the supposedly fundamentalist schisms of the Presbyterian Church of Korea in the 1950s, which both Kim and Rhee reasoned to have been originated from their Old Princeton theology. The theological rationale of both Kim and Rhee was the Barthian triumph frame that the Reformed Orthodoxy including the Old Princeton theology, which had been suspected of having a fundamentalist tendency, was overcome by Karl Barth's Neo-Orthodoxy. These theological anti-missionary criticisms facilitated some younger Korean church historians, especially both Kyung-Bae Min and Man-Yul Lee, to view Korean church history from an anti-missionary, Korean ethnic nationalist perspective. Min emphasizes some seemingly good but anecdotal works of individual Korean native Christians, hence resulting in depreciation of the works of the missionaries and their Korean coworkers. Following Min, Lee goes even further, praising what some individual Korean Christians did for socio-political (anti-establishment) purposes and ignoring what the missionaries and their Korean coworkers did cooperatively for their Korean churches. Those Korean theologians and church historians with quite a strong anti-missionary sentiment might have succeeded in arousing Korean Christians' ethnic nationalism, but in so doing, they have quite surely deprived Korean Christians of their critically significant and rich ecclesiastical and theological elements which have been originated from the missionaries.","[Hwang, Jae-Buhm] Keimyung Univ, Dept Christian Studies, Systemat Theol, Daegu, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Hwang, JB (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Dept Christian Studies, Systemat Theol, Daegu, South Korea.",jbhwang@kmu.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0259-9422,2072-8050,,HTS TEOL STUD-THEOL,HTS Teol.

This type of investigation will contribute for developing a domestic robot infrastructure in Korea. Design/methodology/approach - A structural equation model is used to investigate the relation among various factors that have a potential influence on robot utilization. in addition, the Robot Utilization Expectation Index of various user groups is developed. The results obtained from the proposed model are expected to provide important feedback information for productivity innovation at the level of both the individual user and the company. Findings - According to the results, the robot function has the highest direct effect on the Robot Utilization Expectation, but excessive policies implemented simultaneously by the Korean Government are not effective on revitalization of the robot industry. it is interesting to note that government policy has the highest indirect effect on robot utilization expectation. Therefore, it is proposed that the government should act as a mediator and focus on fewer policies rather than enforcing various policies simultaneously by different organizations. Research limitations/implications - Although, a focused group consisting of those who are knowledgeable about intelligent robots is surveyed, a limitation to the paper lies in analyzing a relatively small data set. An extended survey with a larger data set remains for future study. Practical implications - The paper includes implications, which contribute towards stimulating the robot industry in Korea. Originality/value - The proposed model is expected to provide important information for productivity innovation at both the individual user and company levels.","[Sohn, So Young; Kim, Man Jae] Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Sohn, SY (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",sohns@yonsei.ac.kr,"Sohn, So/G-8043-2012",,,,,,55,4,4,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,1758-5791,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

With the high domestic market share of local movies (recording more than 40% market share continuously from 2001), it has been reported that Korea is the only nation during the post-Vietnam War history that would regain its domestic audiences after losing them to Hollywood (Kim, 2004). Based on this domestic achievement, Korean cinema's foreign exports have also drastically increased, from 14 movies that generated revenue of US$173,838 in 1993 to 202 movies that reached about US$75 million in 2005 (Korean Film Council, 2010). Despite this achievement, trade headlines and popular news reports have continued to rave about these external figures while ignoring significant internal changes from within the Korean film industry. In addition, there is a tendency among scholars to interpret this commercial achievement simply as successful resistance against American cultural imperialism within the local vs. global paradigm. In order to understand the cultures of production (du Gay, 1997) of the current Korean film industry, this study examines the changing industrial formations and ownership concentration processes in the Korean film industry of the 2000s against the backdrop of distinct media globalization processes. It relates this finding to larger discussions concerning the overseas development of the Korean Wave or Hallyu. From this political-economic approach, it is expected that readers can gain a more holistic understanding of the Korean film industry and the Korean Wave.","Sungshin Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungshin Women's University,"Shim, D (corresponding author), Sungshin Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",mediapoet@gmail.com,"Shim, Doobo/AAX-8611-2020",,,,,,25,8,9,2,37,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"2800 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DAEGU, DALSEO-GU 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,JUN,2011,14,1,,,,,213,227,,,,,,15,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,887GY,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000299916100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

By focusing on the roles of the Korean state, cultural industry, and creative workers as crucial actors in the creation of the Korean Wave, this study examines whether a proper place for creative labour has been established in the context of the Korean Wave's success. To answer this question, this study explores how each crucial actor within the Korean Wave has viewed and treated the problem of labour. First, it analyses how the Korean state has continuously promoted industrial policy while undercutting labour policy in its cultural industry. Second, it traces how the industry has legitimised unfair labour practices as unavoidable to exploit its creative workforce. Third, it traces how creative workers themselves have largely promoted their self-identity as cultural entrepreneurs and artistic creators while diminishing their identity as creative workers. Based on this overview of the continuity and change in the Korean cultural industry, this study reorients industrial sustainability discourse on the Korean Wave, examining its possibilities and future direction as a venue for alternative cultural production by putting creative labour in its place.","[Kim, Changwook] Handong Global Univ, Global Leadership Sch, Pohang, South Korea; [Lee, Sangkyu] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Media & Commun, 425,1 Gangwondaehakgil, Chunchon 24341, Gangwon, South Korea",Handong Global University; Kangwon National University,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Media & Commun, 425,1 Gangwondaehakgil, Chunchon 24341, Gangwon, South Korea.",postdoal@gmail.com,"Kim, Changwook/AFD-1643-2022","Kim, Changwook/0000-0002-7657-2094; Lee, Sangkyu/0000-0002-8275-6324",,,,,60,2,3,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

In this context, the evolution of genres occurred through the transformation and development of Korean cinema. The most distinguished feature of the silent era was the conflict between nationalist recognition and colonial policy. The former became an issue due to national realism and the famous film Arirang (Na Un-gyu, 1926), which was seen as problematic due to Japan's political suppression and censorship. After the switch to sound in 1935, the liberation and the Korean War brought about new trends, such as independent cinema, anti-Japanese cinema, and anti-communist cinema. In the 1950s and 1960s the popularity of Korean cinema was secured through melodrama and the star system. The Korean cinema of the 1980s existed in the context of cultural changes, such as the introduction of color TV and the opening of the film market, and political changes. At that time, critical realist films that expressed longing for periodical changes, erotic cinema that showed a cross-section of regression, and independent cinema that advocated the participation of society co-existed peacefully. With these historical changes in mind, it can be said that Korean cinema is still interested in reenacting national realism and affirming national identity. On the other hand, it also endlessly seeks the creation of meaning in the new topography of the Korean New Wave, which has drawn international attention to Korean cinema and performance, as well as well-made cinema and the planning cinema created with the capital of affluent conglomerates.","[Kim, Jeong; Hong, Sogu] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund of 2014.,,10,0,0,0,6,CROATIAN FILM CLUBS ASSOC,ZAGREB,"HRVATSKI FILMSKI SAVEZ, TUSKANAC 1, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",1330-7665,,,HRVAT FILM LJETOP,Hrvat.

Its historic achievement dates back to the cinema movement from the 1980s to the mid-1990s and its effect, the so-called Korean New Wave. The Korean New Wave films tried to overcome the limitations of modern Korean movies with auteurism and realism, showing a departure in its criticism of mainstream movies and oppressive social conditions. Since the mid-1990s, however, Korean films have diverged again from the Korean New Wave. While critical attitudes and a search for realism significantly waned, an ironic tendency and interests in genre and mass culture grew. Post-Korean New Wave films now focus on image more than on theme, which tells us that the newness of today's Korean cinema only functions as a stylistic strategy used to distinguish themselves from other films. Closely related to changes in Korean politics, economy, and culture are those of the meaning, role, and function of newness in Korean films, through which we can understand the circumstances and trends of Korean films today.",,,,jcmoon@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,9,12,1,14,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2006,46,1,,,,,36,59,,,,,,24,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,043DF,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000237578900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through discursive analysis, this article examines the positioning of web dramas as a step in the evolution of television and finds that they have been legitimized as a higher-quality form than television drama because of their economic potential. To begin with, web dramas have the potential to generate synergistic economic effects impacting other areas of culture, such as tourism, television, and webtoons. Second, web dramas have been represented as the best strategy for tapping into the vast Chinese market, especially during periods in which strained political relations between Korea and China prevented the export of television dramas. Moreover, web dramas have been optimized for mobile platforms through experimentation with aesthetics and topics in ways that have not been possible for television dramas. Thus, web dramas offer a window into the relationship between perceptions of quality and commercial profitability.","[Kang, Jennifer M.] Depauw Univ, Dept Commun & Theatre, Greencastle, IN 46135 USA",DePauw University,"Kang, JM (corresponding author), Depauw Univ, Commun & Theatre, 204 E Seminary, Greencastle, IN 46135 USA.",jenniferkang@depauw.edu,"Kang, Jennifer/ABC-1662-2021","Kang, Jennifer/0000-0001-9136-0594",,,,,71,2,2,13,68,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1367-8779,1460-356X,,INT J CULTURAL STUD,Int.

Most of the used documents are from the records of the BCP Central Committee and Politburo, the funds of the National Assembly (parliament), the Council of Ministers (government), other ministries and state agencies, as well as the official records of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Another important source for archival information used for the analyses are the documents from the State Military Historical Archive in Veliko Tarnovo. Documents from the Bulgarian archives outline two key issues related to the Korean War and Bulgarian position on this conflict and the engagement of the country in it. First of all, this is the topic of the moral support for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). This is done through a number of regular official positions of the Bulgarian government as well as of various socio-political and civil society organizations which expressed their position of Bulgarian solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle for unity and national independence. Many of these positions at different levels are directed at a number of international organizations and their forums raising voice in support of the position of DPRK. The second big issue is related to the humanitarian aid that Bulgaria has given to the DPRK in the course of the war. This theme has three main dimensions that deserve attention. First of all, this is the issue of organizing mass campaigns among the Bulgarian population and institutions for voluntary donation and material assistance for the population of the DPRK. Secondly, a part of the humanitarian aid that Bulgaria is providing to the DPRK is the decision of the Bulgarian government to send no medical missions to Korea and to organize a hospital to help the military and civilian victims of military action. Thirdly the issue about one of the largest humanitarian campaigns that the Eastern Bloc countries organized, the acceptation for raising and care of children who have remained orphans as a consequence of the war. The study of the documents related to the Korean War provides an extremely interesting insight into the War, through the prism of social history, the effect of the war on ordinary people, the lives of the Korean population in these heaviest years of its historical development after the World War II.","[Kandilarov, Evgeniy] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Dept East Asian Languages & Cultures, Fac Class & Modern Philol, Ctr Eastern Languages & Studies, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Soyoung, Kim] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Ctr Korean Studies, Fac Class & Modern Philol, Ctr Eastern Languages & Studies, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Sofia; University of Sofia,"Kandilarov, E (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Dept East Asian Languages & Cultures, Fac Class & Modern Philol, Ctr Eastern Languages & Studies, Sofia, Bulgaria.",ekandilarov@hotmail.com; soyoungbulgaria@hanmail.net,"Kandilarov, Evgeniy/AAM-2606-2021","Kandilarov, Evgeniy/0000-0003-4810-0417",Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of the Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2015-OLU-2250004],"Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of the Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Core University Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of the Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2015-OLU-2250004).,,14,0,0,0,2,PUBL HOUSE BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,SOFIA,"ACADEMICIAN G BONCEV ST, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",0204-8906,,,BULG HIST REV-REV B,Bulgarian Hist.

Major churches in South Korea are founded by pastors from what is today North Korea, who were persecuted by the communist regime and defected to the south before the Korean War. We show that Protestants in South Korea profess stronger feelings against the North Korean regime, likely motivated by politically charged sermons and strong church congregant networks. As a case examining the Protestant impact on politics, we document how Protestant voters influenced recent presidential election outcomes in South Korea by supporting the conservative party, whose firm stance against the northern neighbor aligned with the group's own.

One could argue South Korea is accustomed to these repetitive launches splashing into the Pacific Ocean, at times nearing two dozen in a year, but the republic has its sets of policy alternatives when responding to the neighbor's aggression. To understand South Korea's decision-making mechanism, I utilize the 'Poliheuristic Theory' developed by Mintz. A decision matrix consisting of three policy alternatives (passive by-standing, reaching out, joint drills) is applied to three crisis moments from 2013, 2017, 2022. Primary and secondary sources like defense ministry press releases and news reports are used for data collection. The North's tests are closely observed by the South but usually not responded to provocations. When South Korea decides to respond, the tendency is to carry the issue to the international audience by citing U.N. Convention, Armistice Agreement, etc. The presence of the U.S. military in the peninsula plays a crucial role, as seen from the remarkably increased tests after the U.S. declared it would lessen military involvement. Several domestic and regional criteria (the Sunshine Policy, eventual unification possibility, U.S. military presence, asymmetrical capabilities, regional status quo) has possible influence over leaders' responses.","[Dengiz, Pelin] Bilkent Univ, Int Relat MA, Ankara, Turkiye",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Dengiz, P (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, Int Relat MA, Ankara, Turkiye.",pelin.dengiz@bilkent.edu.tr,,"Dengiz, Pelin/0000-0003-0524-8091",,,,,42,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

However, the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) system and the Korean economic crisis of 1997 forced the government to accelerate its full privatization plan. During this process, several main players such as the Korean government, transnational corporations, international organizations, and large domestic conglomerates played important roles.

S.",,,Going Global: The Transformation of the Korean Catholic Church,JOURNAL OF KOREAN RELIGIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Keywords; Korean Catholic Church; Korean missionaries; global Catholicism; globalization,,"This paper examines the globalizationof the Korean Catholic Church (KCC). Despite its short history, the KCC has been transformed from a Church receiving missionaries and economic support to one sending them. The KCC has not only sent missionaries abroad, but has engaged in international development through its financial support and by running international developmental NGOs. This paper examines the ecclesial and social factors that have brought about this transformation in the KCC and contemplates its implications for global and Korean Catholicism. Among ecclesial factors, it highlights not merely the KCC's growth but also the decline of religious and priestly vocations in traditionally Catholic countries of the West. It also stresses Korea's globalization as a social factor. The KCC's globalization challenges the conventional stereotype of both the Christian Westand Confucian Korea.Contemporary Korea is influenced by Christianity, both Protestantism and Catholicism, no less than Confucianism. Moreover, it denotes that Catholicism has not been exhausted by the West, but is being enriched by Korean Catholics.","[Kim, Denis W.

Ischemic stroke patients tend to delay arrival at the hospital and often miss the golden 3-hour window, which is optimal for tissue plasminogen activator treatment. Objective: The purposes of this study were to compare demographic, clinical/behavioral, and sociocultural characteristics of ischemic stroke patients who reside in urban and rural areas of Korea and to identify factors contributing to the time taken from symptom onset to hospital arrival. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted using a structured survey in a convenience sample of 229 ischemic stroke patients in Korea. Results: Individuals who resided in rural areas were more likely to be female, older, less educated; had lower incomes; contacted adult children at the onset of stroke; and took a longer time to be transported to a hospital than did those who resided in urban areas (P < .05). Patients who visited an emergency room, transferred via an ambulance, contacted emergency medical services, perceived symptoms as serious, had a family history of stroke, or experienced hemiparesis as the primary stroke symptom arrived at the hospital relatively sooner, whereas patients who experienced unclear symptoms took relatively more time to arrive at the hospital following symptom onset (P < .05). Conclusions: Nationwide efforts are needed to promote public awareness of stroke and to develop strategies to reduce prehospital delay time for ischemic stroke patients, particularly those who reside in rural areas in Korea.","[Sim, Jeongha] Jeonju Univ, Dept Nursing, Jeonju, South Korea; [Shin, Cha-Nam] Arizona State Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Innovat, 500 N 3rd St, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [An, Kyungeh] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Todd, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Coll Nursing Hlth Innovat, Phoenix, AZ USA",Jeonju University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Virginia Commonwealth University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Shin, CN (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Innovat, 500 N 3rd St, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",Cha-Nam.Shin@asu.edu,"; Todd, Michael/MSZ-3297-2025","Todd, Michael/0000-0002-1981-4245;","Basic Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2011-0014173]","Basic Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","J.S. received a grant from the Basic Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2011-0014173) in 2011.

Though its leaders often speak of the desire for reunification, North Korea will not and could not pursue a successful nuclear coercion strategy because it carries an inordinate amount of risk, even for Pyongyang, which raises serious doubts about the credibility of its nuclear threats, the possibility of success, and the likelihood of pursuing such a strategy in the first place.

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, we examined how much death from specific diseases contributed to these gaps in different age groups over three decades.Methods: Data for death numbers and population by sex and 5-year age groups in both North and South Korea from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the GBD 2019 to calculate life expectancy. Joinpoint regression analysis was conducted to investigate changes in life expectancy in North and South Korea. We used decomposition analysis to partition differences in life expectancy within and between the two Koreas into changes in age-and cause-specific death contributions.Results: Life expectancy increased in two Koreas from 1990 to 2019, but North Korea experienced a marked decline in life expectancy during the mid-1990s. The life expectancy gaps between the two Koreas were greatest in 1999, with a difference of 13.3 years for males and 14.9 years for females. The main contributors to these gaps were higher under-5 mortality from nutritional deficiencies for males (4.62 years) and females (4.57 years) in North Korea, accounting for about 30% of the total gap in life expectancy. After 1999, the life expectancy gaps reduced but persisted with differences of about ten years by 2019. Notably, chronic diseases contributed to about 8 out of 10 years of life expectancy gap between the two Koreas in 2019. Differential cardiovascular disease mortality in the older groups was the main contributor to the life expectancy gap.Conclusions: The contributors to this gap have shifted from nutritional deficiencies in children younger than five years to cardiovascular disease among elderly people. Efforts for strengthening social and healthcare systems are needed to curb this large gap.","[Choi, Minjae] Korea Univ, Inst Future Publ Hlth, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Minjae; Sempungu, Joshua Kirabo; Lee, Eun Hae; Lee, Yo Han] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Sempungu, Joshua Kirabo; Lee, Eun Hae] Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Program Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Yo Han] 73 Goryeodae Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University,"Lee, YH (corresponding author), 73 Goryeodae Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",vionic@korea.ac.kr,"; Sempungu, Joshua Kirabo/ITV-6801-2023; Lee, Yo Han/IUN-3410-2023","Lee, Yo Han/0000-0002-9631-9969; Choi, Minjae/0000-0003-2057-7360;",National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF- 2022R1A6A3A01086222]; Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs; Korea University; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Education; [NRF-2021R1G1A1095517],"National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs; Korea University; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea);","Yo Han Lee was supported by grants from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT [grant number: NRF-2021R1G1A1095517] , Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, and Korea University.

Acoustic data were collected from eight LT transplants, five short-term (ST) transplants, and 11 Seoul speakers to examine whether exposure to Seoul Korean (SK) affects Gyeongsang speakers' cue-weighting in distinguishing stops in production. LT transplants produced stimuli in both Gyeongsang and Seoul dialects. A cue-weighting model based on the acoustic data reveals that voice onset time (VOT) is less important to distinguish lenis from aspirated stops for Seoul speakers and for LT transplants' SK, as compared to ST transplants and LT transplants' Gyeongsang Korean (GK). In addition, fundamental frequency (F0) is more important for the lenis-aspirated distinction for Seoul speakers and LT transplants' SK, as compared to ST and LT transplants' GK, showing that LT transplants rely less on VOT and more on F0 to distinguish lenis from aspirated stops compared to ST transplants. LT transplants' SK reveals that they rely more on VOT and less on F0 compared to SK speakers. The cue-weighting model of the LT transplants provide empirical evidence that a series of sound changes in GK is due to inter-dialect contact.","[Kim, Hyoju; Jongman, Allard] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Linguist, 1541 Lilac Lane,Blake Hall,Room 427, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",kimhj@ku.edu,"Kim, Hyoju/HZI-6781-2023; jongman, allard/A-8377-2009","Kim, Hyoju/0000-0002-3357-4460; jongman, allard/0000-0002-7384-2036",,,,,51,5,6,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0023-8309,1756-6053,,LANG SPEECH,Lang.

This is not the first time that the world has experienced a cultural wave from the Korean Peninsula. The Asian martial arts craze that swept the West in the 1970s and 1980s would have been incomplete without such Korean contributions as Taekwondo, Hapkido and others that introduced the world to Korean culture long before the Hallyu of the late 1990s and early 2000s. With this in mind, a closer examination of the Korean martial wave can be instrumental in understanding the country's current cultural interactions with the rest of the world. This article analyses the forces behind this wave by dividing them into two dichotomic categories: those originating from Korean culture and society (the transmitter), and those generated by cultural and social processes in the rest of the world (the receiver). The article concludes that the transmitter's promotional efforts contributed to the overall success of Korean martial arts expansion to a far greater extent than the forces on the receiving side.","[Rozenfeld, Evgenia] Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Rozenfeld, E (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel.",mitra.chinha@gmail.com,,"Rozenfeld (Lachina), Eugenia/0000-0001-7007-9728",,,,,72,1,3,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

This paper analyzes three films from the mid-2000s dealing with North Korean issues (A Bold Family [2005], Over the Border [2006], and Welcome to Dongmakgol [2005]) in the context of the South Korean political landscape and North-South relations at the time. The paper argues that mid-2000s films represent a transitional point in the filmic depiction of North Koreans in South Korean film, opening up possibilities of hybridity in Korean identity. These films exhibit an almost ethnographic impulse to document everyday life, and as such contribute broadly to a visual anthropology of North-South Korean relations.","[Tilland, Bonnie] Yonsei Univ, East Asia Int Coll, Mirae Campus, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Tilland, B (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, East Asia Int Coll, Mirae Campus, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,2,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, COLL INT STUDIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES",TAIPEI,"162 HEPING EAST RD, SECTION 1, TAIPEI, 106, TAIWAN",1729-6897,1729-8792,,CONCENTRIC,Concentric,SEP,2020,46,2,,,,,217,245,,10.6240/concentric.lit.202009_46(2).0010,http://dx.doi.org/10.6240/concentric.lit.202009_46(2).0010,,,29,Literary Theory & Criticism; Literature,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Literature,NZ8JO,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000577348100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ideas of modern education and nationalism had already emerged among Koreans before 1945 when they achieved independence from Japanese colonization. In this sense, during the US and Soviet military regimes, education reforms were conducted in light of already existing efforts for nation-building by indigenous Korean leaders. The hopes and desires of the leaders of the two Koreas, as expressed by their adoption of new ideologies within the newly established military governments, represented a clear break from the past-be that Japanese colonialism or Confucian traditionalism-and a firm determination to change the present for the future in accordance with these ideologies. In the field of education, this change occurred with the introduction of John Dewey's liberal educational philosophy to rebuild the education system in South Korea, and with the adoption of socialist educational philosophies such as polytechnicism and collectivism in North Korea.","[Kim, Sun] Korean Educ Dev Inst, Jincheon, South Korea; [Jung, Dong-Joon] Inha Univ, Dept Social Studies Educ, Incheon, South Korea",Inha University,"Jung, DJ (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Social Studies Educ, Incheon, South Korea.",hert1451@kedi.re.kr; djjung@inha.ac.kr,,"Jung, Dong-Joon/0000-0002-6599-9957",,,,,66,2,3,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1598-1037,1876-407X,,ASIA PAC EDUC REV,Asia Pac.

Cancer screening can reduce the burden of cancer but cancer screening rates among Koreans remain low. The purposes of this study were to a) understand Koreans' beliefs and knowledge about cancer screening, and b) explore preferred strategies for increasing cancer screening utilization. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, qualitative study using eight face-to-face focus groups with a total of 64 Koreans aged 40 and over. Participants answered semi-structured, open-ended questions assessing their experiences with, and beliefs, knowledge, and opinions about, cancer screening. All interview data were recorded and analyzed in the context of the health belief model (HBM). Results: The most important themes that emerged from the focus group data were (a) perceived susceptibility (most of the participants believed they were not susceptible to cancer; those who perceived themselves susceptible to cancer were reluctant to express it); (b) perceived benefits (early detection and feelings of relief after cancer screening were benefits; participants had screening because they wanted to take advantage of the Korean government's Medical Payment Support program for cancer patients who have participated in the National Cancer Screening program); (c) perceived barriers (no symptoms; self-care when having symptoms; widespread distrust of tests, doctors, and hospitals; unkind health care providers; the financial burdens of advanced cancer screening tests; and the discomfort during cancer screening); and (d) knowledge of the causes of cancer (incorrect knowledge including beliefs that stress, personality, and body overuse cause cancer). Almost all of the participants were very knowledgeable about the seriousness of cancer and were confident that they were able to have cancer screening. Participants preferred strategies of cancer screening using group interventions with family or friends; various information delivery methods; information emphasizing the importance of cancer prevention; convenient, free, or inexpensive services; and kind health care providers. Conclusions: This HBM-based research suggests that beliefs in low susceptibility to cancer, many barriers to cancer screening, and incorrect knowledge should be the foci for increasing cancer screening rates in Koreans. Interventions could change individual cultural beliefs and increase knowledge as well as the quality of health care for Koreans.","[Lee, Shin-Young] Chosun Univ, Dept Nursing, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 501759, South Korea; [Lee, Eunice E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Nursing, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",Chosun University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Lee, SY (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, Dept Nursing, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 501759, South Korea.",shinyoung0114@gmail.com,,,Chosun University [2015-206644-02],Chosun University,"This study was supported by research fund from Chosun University, 2015 (2015-206644-02).

Fisher first came to Korea in 1919 as a missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and taught at Chosen Christian College until 1934. Having published Democracy and Mission Education in Korea (1928), based on his PhD dissertation, Fisher introduced John Dewey's ideas on democracy and education to colonial Korea and tried to reinterpret the goals of mission education there. He argued for democracy as an educational goal when many Koreans were energized by new trends such as socialism. After Japan's defeat in 1945 and with Korea under divided occupation, Fisher returned to Korea in 1946 as a USAMGIK official for political education and public relations. He sought to propagate American democracy in southern Korea, participated in the US-USSR Joint Commission talks in 1947, and helped to establish the South Korean government in 1948. Fisher's ideas and activities show a unique aspect of Korean-American relations in terms of how Christian mission and a certain view of democracy were articulated under Japanese colonial rule, and during the formative period leading to the establishment of the Republic of Korea.","[An, Jong-Chol] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Asian & North African Studies, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"An, JC (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Asian & North African Studies, Venice, Italy.",Jongchol.an@unive.it,,,Seed Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2020-INC-2230010],"Seed Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Seed Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2020-INC-2230010).

We argue that the US' efforts to bolster deterrence against North Korea's growing threats through missile defense have resulted in China's countermeasures of enhancing survivability and penetrability of its second-strike capability, leading to downward spirals of tensions between Beijing and Washington. We explain how three structural factors - geography, the US alliance system, and nuclear asymmetry - have made diffuse signaling salient, thus making it very challenging for the United States to reassure China even when its actions targeted North Korea. The article empirically shows the action-reaction process through which China and the US have come to experience the aggravation of the security dilemma over the Korean peninsula.","[Ekmektsioglou, Eleni; Lee, Ji-Young] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Lee, JY (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jiyoungl@american.edu,,,,,,,120,3,3,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

Methods Data were collected from qualitative interviews with older people, community leaders and professionals in Christchurch and Auckland. Data analysis was conducted using concept mapping techniques in the cross-cultural context where two languages were simultaneously used. Results The findings of the study show that older Korean people in New Zealand were likely to face multiple challenges due to the combined effects of immigration and ageing in a new country. Some older people experienced difficulties in managing their immigrant lives and intergenerational relationships in the transnational family context in which their family members were dispersed across two or more nations. Conclusion The immigrant experiences of older migrants might be affected by an 'invisible' source of isolation and exclusion at familial, community, societal and transnational levels.","[Park, Hong-Jae] Univ Auckland, Sch Counselling Human Serv & Social Work, Fac Educ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Kim, Chang Gi] Chungju Natl Univ, Dept Social Welf, Jeungpyong Gun, Chungbuk, South Korea",University of Auckland,"Park, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Counselling Human Serv & Social Work, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",hj.park@auckland.ac.nz,"Park, Hong-Jae/J-9564-2016","Park, Hong-Jae/0000-0002-2271-7489",Social Policy Evaluation and Research Committee (SPEaR),Social Policy Evaluation and Research Committee (SPEaR),"Special gratitude is owed to the participants who shared their personal experiences, feelings and thoughts.

An international commission is an ad hoc transnational investigative mechanism, which dependent upon its sponsors and constitution can be thought of as either a temporary intergovernmental organization or nongovernmental organization (NGO). They are routinely led by senior, respected politicians or leaders and include a range of similarly respected commissioners, including government, military, academic, and NGO representatives. Their end goal is the production of a comprehensive and definitive report that will serve as a reference point for future diplomatic initiatives. Their strength lies in the power of ideas-the capacity to transform the way we think about entrenched, long-standing international problems.

The point of departure of this work is the idea that Westerners' conception of the Orient in this period was not monolithic but hierarchically structured. What this article attempts is thus to reveal the distinct position Korea occupied within the assumed Orient, a position different from, and assigned particularly in relation to, that of Japan. It will be shown that Korea was perceived by British newspapers as a Japanese Egypt, an image made possible by the imperialist notion of the modern state shared, overtly or otherwise, by both British and Japanese intellectuals and discrimination in the application of the idea of national freedom. While Korea was largely perceived in terms of what were presumably inherent Oriental traits such as inertness, conservativeness, and laziness, the British accorded a distinct sense of otherness to Korea based on their individualized yet hierarchical understanding of the Orient. Therefore, the phrase 'a Japanese Egypt,' coined to describe Korea, represents the marginalized position Korea occupied within the British conception of the Orient.","[Jong-Pil, Yoon] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Intercultural Relat, Asan, South Korea",Soonchunhyang University,"Jong-Pil, Y (corresponding author), Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Intercultural Relat, Asan, South Korea.",jpyoon1982@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,3,4,0,7,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,DEC,2016,19,2,,,,,31,57,,10.18399/acta.2016.19.2.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2016.19.2.002,,,27,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,EJ0DM,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000392878800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, South Korean perceptions of North Koreans' level of preparedness for working in a capitalist society present the most compelling linkages to economic securitisation. With respect to Christian Iraqi refugees in Jordan, plausible connections can be drawn between societal security and an Iraqi identity generally. With respect to economic concerns in Jordan, measures taken to restrict Iraqi integration into the labour force can be seen as security actions.","[Collet, Bruce A.; Bang, Hyeyoung] Bowling Green State Univ, Educ Fdn Leadership & Policy, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Collet, BA (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Educ Fdn Leadership & Policy, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",colleba@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,51,5,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,MAR 3,2016,46,2,,,,,272,292,,10.1080/03057925.2014.952712,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057925.2014.952712,,,21,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,DG2QI,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000371911900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of SK media over two decades-mainly longitudinal analysis of evangelical newspaper Kidok Sinmun (1998-2019)-generates several findings. First, homosexuality is catching up to North Korea as the leading outgroup in SK Christian discourse. Second, both outgroups are subjects of dual, competing narratives: one (threat) frames outgroups, and their supporters, as threats to the liberties and/or values of Christians; another (outreach), as subjects of Christian love and personal relationship. The threat and outreach narratives, in turn, are, respectively, associated with right-wing and non-right politics on the outgroup. We argue that the dual narratives are shaped by American evangelical culture; cross-national communications (e.g., South Korea and USA); and cross-national events (e.g., presidential elections) that influence the perceived threats posed by, or opportunities to outreach to, outgroup members.","[Lee, Wondong] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Yi, Joseph] Hanyang Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Hanyang University,"Yi, J (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",joyichicago@yahoo.com,"Yi, Joseph E./ACS-5880-2022","Yi, Joseph E./0000-0002-3126-8515",Hanyang University Research Fund; Jack Shand Grant Program from the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion; Kugelman Citizen Peacebuilding Research Fellowship; Humane Studies Fellowship,Hanyang University Research Fund; Jack Shand Grant Program from the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion; Kugelman Citizen Peacebuilding Research Fellowship; Humane Studies Fellowship,This article was supported by Hanyang University Research Fund and Jack Shand Grant Program from the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.

Lee's protagonist Henry Park is a second-generation Korean American coached to be 'unapparent and flat' as part of his role as ethnic spy, while Choi's Professor Lee is a 'person of interest' to the FBI as a suspect for the Brain Bomber. Affectless and generic, Park and Professor Lee at once embody the stereotype of poker-faced, emotionally flat Asians, and then find themselves accused of an 'un-American' lack of expressiveness that leads to social immiscibility and even potential criminality. Both texts play with the idea of Asian Americans as 'alien,' not only figuratively so but interpellated into roles of espionage or possible terrorism, and consider how Asian American subjectivity is linked to diasporic origin. In reading these works within a transpacific context, I discuss the significance of a 'native speaker' within a contemporary Korean context and read the Korean language punning behind Lee's novel. In Choi's novel, I consider the significance of the author's refusal to identity her protagonist's Asian country of origin, as well as her imputed linkage between Japan and terrorism.","Yonsei Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Park, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",,,,,,,,39,0,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

In this article, I explore the strategies of three kugak artists who have risen to become not just stars in their field, but with a broader audience as well. Each artist highlights a different path to transcending subcultural kugak stardom: Pak Aeri's appearance on reality TV; Kim Chunsu as a 'kugak idol;' and Yi Huimun's eye-catching performance attire. In tracing the strategies each uses to balance popular fame and traditional artistry, I argue that although a 'celebrity moment' is crucial in order to attain popular stardom, sustained performance of 'celebrity reluctance' in engaging with popular culture remains a necessary strategy for retaining legitimacy as a traditional artist.","[Yates-Lu, Anna] Seoul Natl Univ, Korean Mus Dept, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Yates-Lu, A (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Korean Mus Dept, Seoul, South Korea.",annayateslu@outlook.com,,"Yates-Lu, Anna/0000-0002-1091-5429",,,,,86,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1939-2397,1939-2400,,CELEBR STUD,Celebr.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the majority of ethnic Koreans in Japan supported socialist ideology. The poor publishing environment of the 1940s and 1950s, the censorship of the GHQ, the lack of magazine writers, and economic hardship-all these factors contributed to attracting ethnic Koreans living in Japan to Korean organizations. The magazines, many of which were organs of those very organizations, started out by accommodating the urgent and diverse needs of the Korean community in Japan. Following the Korea-Japan Treaty in the 1960s, there was a change in the question of national identity of ethnic Koreans in Japan, which had been determined so far only in relation to North Korea. This political event, which shook the Korean community in Japan, brought attention back to the political sphere, and various Korean magazines published at this time had to focus on these concerns. In the 1970s, a great change came to the Korean community in Japan. As the second and third generations of ethnic Koreans came to account for a large proportion of the population, the change in the political discourse and cultural consciousness within the Korean community in Japan accelerated. Naturally, as with the notions of national identity and homeland, issues surrounding everyday life and social reality emerged as important factors for Koreans in Japan. These aspects are well represented in the Korean magazines published in this period.","[Lee, Seungjin] Univ Konkuk, Acad Mobil Humanities, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Lee, SJ (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, 1209 Saecheonnyeon Ginyeomgwan,120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea.",missest@daum.net,,"Lee, Seungjin/0000-0002-1331-1516",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A8022367],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A5A8022367).,,16,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

Given the various contexts in which individual KDLI programs operate, this study also compares different parent groups characterized by Korean ethnicity and school characteristics in terms of their responses. The study surveys more than 450 parents of students enrolled in 7 elementary-level KDLI programs in southern California to determine the extent to which parents' reasons vary across different groups and examine whether group differences exist between Korean and non-Korean parents as well as between parents whose children attend high socioeconomic and low socioeconomic status schools. The study discusses the findings by comparing the results to prior literature and identifies implications for KDLI and DLI programs in general.","[Ee, Jongyeon] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Grad Sch Educ & Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Ee, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Grad Sch Educ & Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",joyee@ucla.edu,,,,,,,40,22,34,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

To explain the persistence of this cooperation, we draw upon a local approach to environmental peacebuilding. By tracing inter-Korean forestry cooperation from 2000 to 2018, this study finds that cooperation persists because of a North Korean desire for cooperation specifically on the environment, and because non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with close ties to the South Korean government provided an alternative way to implement inter-Korean forestry cooperation through periods of tension. Our findings also highlight the benefits of using environmental cooperation as a way to engage with North Korea in a depoliticised and sanction-free context. This finding has far-reaching implications for environmental peacebuilding. First, NGOs can pave the way for engaging conflict parties even in the face of ongoing hostility.

It first studies a late-1920s novella that featured the first black-Korean character and foreshadowed the major issues facing black Amerasians in later Korean and Korean American narratives published from the mid-1950s. By putting Korean-language narratives into direct dialogue with their Anglophone counterparts, this transpacific study argues that the texts in Korean and English are complementary to each other and help piece together the diverse aspects of black Amerasian experience in Korea told from the two perspectives, Korean and Korean American. Both Korean and Korean American narratives portray black Amerasians fundamentally as the unfortunate victims of androcentrism, patriarchy, ethnonationalism, militarism, neo-imperialism, and racism. Yet there is a signal difference between the two literatures: whereas Korean narratives focus on black Amerasians' discrimination and ostracization by Koreans, Korean American narratives highlight white racism in U.S. military facilities and criticize US. legal barriers and immigration policy against (black) Amerasians.","Korea Univ, English, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, KJ (corresponding author), Korea Univ, English, Seoul, South Korea.",kunjonglee@outlook.com,"Lee, Jongwon/V-6800-2018",,,,,,55,7,9,0,6,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2015,55,1,,,,,7,30,,,,,,24,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,CF1TC,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000352329800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

An extension of on-going tensions between South Korea's Buddhist and Evangelical Protestant communities, this one-sided wave of violence and harassment has caused the destruction of numerous temple buildings and priceless historical artifacts, millions of USD in damages, and one death. This article surveys these incidents of anti-Buddhist vandalism, arson, and harassment, analyzing their general characteristics and summarizing major instances of each, before examining the frequency of these incidents within the wider chronology of recent Evangelical-Buddhist tensions. It then examines the responses from South Korea's Buddhist and Evangelical communities and various government agencies, as well as the effects of these responses, before investigating the relationship between these incidents and the mainstream Evangelical doctrines of religious exclusivism, dominionism and spiritual warfare. The article closes with a discussion of the need for further research into these incidents and the wider Evangelical-Buddhist tensions surveyed herein as well as the relevance of such research to inter-religious conflicts outside Korea.","[Yoon, Young-Hae] Dongguk Univ, Coll Buddhist Studies & Culture, Gyeongju Campus, Seoul, South Korea; [Jones, Sherwin] Dongguk Univ, Paramita Coll, Gyeongju Campus, Seoul, South Korea",Dongguk University; Dongguk University,"Yoon, YH (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Coll Buddhist Studies & Culture, Gyeongju Campus, Seoul, South Korea.",yyh@dongguk.ac.kr; sherwinjones@gmail.com,,,Dongguk University Research Fund,Dongguk University Research Fund,Dr Young-Hae Yoon has received support for this article through a grant from the 2017 Dongguk University Research Fund.

Methods This study examined the relations of pure copying, copying fluency, and delayed copying to beginning word reading and spelling in Korean Hangul. One hundred and five Korean kindergarten children aged 5 and 6 years were tested on pure copying of unfamiliar print of Vietnamese, copying fluency and delayed copying of Korean Gulja (written syllable), and cognitive skills including nonverbal reasoning, syllable and phoneme awareness, and orthographic awareness. Results Hierarchical regression analyses showed that copying fluency and delayed copying of Korean Gulja uniquely explained Korean word reading and spelling after controlling for age, cognitive skills and Vietnamese copying. In addition, squared semi-partial correlations revealed that orthographic and phonological awareness significantly and uniquely contributed to Korean word reading and spelling. Conclusions The findings highlight that copying fluency and delayed copying of Hangul Gulja are the most important factors in early Korean word recognition and spelling. Similar cognitive correlates such as syllable and orthographic awareness and orthographic working memory contributed to the initial reading and spelling of Korean words.","[Cho, Jeung-Ryeul] Kyungnam Univ, Dept Psychol, Chang Won 51767, South Korea",Kyungnam University,"Cho, JR (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Dept Psychol, Chang Won 51767, South Korea.",jrcho@kyungnam.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5A2A03044034],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5A2A03044034).

Such change is fueled by the rise in interracial relationships between Korean men and non-Korean women. In this article, I address the question: How are Korean masculinity and national identity reconceptualized through interracial relationships? I build on feminist theories on race and eroticism to critically examine the YouTube videos uploaded by couples comprised of Korean men and white women. These videos garner hundreds of thousands of views and become spaces of lively debate about issues of masculinity, nationalism, and femininity. I argue that the viewer responses to the videos mobilize misogynistic binaries that pit supposedly problematic Korean women against the supposedly ideal white women. I demonstrate how misogyny in Korea is being rearticulated to conform to the nation's demographic shift.","[Lee, Min Joo] Occidental Coll, Dept Asian Studies, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA USA",Occidental College,"Lee, MJ (corresponding author), Occidental Coll, Dept Asian Studies, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA USA.",mlee4@oxy.edu,,,,,,,46,3,3,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1097-184X,1552-6828,,MEN MASC,Men Masc.,APR,2024,27,1,,,,,42,60,,10.1177/1097184X241229675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X241229675,,JAN 2024,19,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,MN9J7,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001146916700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximum body heights of C2 through L5 were measured from 75 Korean and 51 U.S. males to generate discriminant functions. U.S. vertebral heights were statistically greater than Koreans in 18 out of 23 vertebrae (C2, C4-6, T3-6, and T8-L5). The functions with lumbar vertebrae tended to yield higher correct classification ratios (CCR) than those with cervical or thoracic vertebrae. Inclusion of the femur and tibia lengths in the vertebrae-involved functions enhanced the CCR's. Discriminant functions using the femur and tibia length were also presented.

Bridging these two bodies of work, the current study examined the perceptual benefits of heritage language experience for heritage speakers of Korean in both the heritage language (Korean) and the dominant language (American English). It was hypothesized that, due to their early bilingual experience and the different nature of unreleased stops in Korean and American English, heritage speakers of Korean would show not only native-like perception of Korean unreleased stops, but also better-than-native perception of American English unreleased stops. Results of three perception experiments were consistent with this hypothesis, suggesting that benefits of early heritage language experience can extend well beyond the heritage language.","[Chang, Charles B.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Chang, CB (corresponding author), Boston Univ, CAS Linguist Program, 621 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",cbchang@post.harvard.edu,"Chang, Charles B./M-1343-2016; Chang, Charles/M-1343-2016","Chang, Charles B./0000-0002-3537-2053;",Center for Advanced Study of Language; Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences; Second Language Acquisition Program at the University of Maryland,Center for Advanced Study of Language; Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences; Second Language Acquisition Program at the University of Maryland,"The author gratefully acknowledges technical, financial, and logistical support from the Center for Advanced Study of Language, the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences, and the Second Language Acquisition Program at the University of Maryland and helpful feedback from four anonymous reviewers and audiences at the CUNY Graduate Center, the 2013 Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, and the 7th Heritage Language Research Institute.",,98,47,64,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1366-7289,1469-1841,,BILING-LANG COGN,Biling.-Lang.

At the core of this positive engagement has been the environmental movement. Christian and Buddhist environmental activists have set a model agenda and viable action plans, and share a conception of the meaning of life and human happiness revolving around various environmental issues. To show how the environmental movement has brought the two parties closer, this article examines how ecological concerns emerged within the two religions in the first place, explores the ways they managed to cooperate on concrete environmental issues, and assesses the extent to which those common efforts have been successful.

The aim of the study was to identify KM utilization patterns using a national representative sample data. Methods: KM users aged 0-80 years and older from the nationally representative sample in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort of 778,506KM users between 2002 and 2013 (were analyzed. Annual changes in utilization patterns were analyzed by sex, nine age groups, five income levels, and numbers of visits and hospitalizations. Utilization patterns by the type of healthcare institution and the top 10 major diseases were studied. Results: Frequencies of KM use differed according to analyses of patients and claims. Women used KM 1.5 times more than did men. Patients in their 40s and 50s made up one third of KM users. In contrast to other studies, high-income groups used KM more than did low-income groups. More than 96% of ambulatory patients used mostly KM clinics, and more than 76% of inpatients used KM hospitals. Musculoskeletal disorders were the main disease treated, which conformed to the results of previous studies. Conclusion: The results suggest that women, people in their 40s and 50s, and people with a relatively high income use KM more often than other patients.

This paper is a report of a comparison of advice on lifestyle given by healthcare providers and subsequent action by recipients between Korean Americans and native Koreans with hypertension. Background. High blood pressure is controllable by having a healthy lifestyle, such as weight control, dietary change, exercise, low-sodium diet, alcohol restriction and smoking cessation, and by taking medication. Healthcare providers play an important role in teaching individuals with hypertension on healthy lifestyles. Method. This descriptive comparative study was conducted with a convenience sample of 100 Korean Americans and 100 native Koreans with hypertension. They were interviewed between May 2003 and June 2004 on the advice they received from healthcare providers on lifestyle and their subsequent action in terms of taking medication, weight control, dietary change, exercise, low-sodium diet, smoking cessation, alcohol restriction and tension reduction. Nutrient profiles were examined using the 24-hour dietary recall method. Findings. Korean Americans received advice on lifestyle less than did native Koreans, but more Korean Americans followed healthy lifestyle advice on dietary change and exercise than did native Koreans (P < 0.001). Weight control was the least adhered to behaviour among the Korean Americans, although almost two-thirds of them were overweight or obese. Both groups exceeded the Dietary Reference Intakes of sodium, but perceived their sodium consumption as low. Conclusion. Native Korean participants need to pay closer attention to carrying out the advice, whereas healthcare providers to Korean Americans need to give more advice on culturally acceptable healthy lifestyles, particularly on dietary changes and weight control. Both groups need to monitor their sodium intake more realistically. It is not only advice from healthcare providers that is integral to control of hypertension, but also that patients should follow that advice.","[Lee, Suk Jeong] Red Cross Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Mi Ja] Univ Illinois, Coll Nursing, Dept Biobehav Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Ahn, Yang-Heui] Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Nursing, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Hyeonkyeong] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Nursing Policy Res Inst, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Chung Ang University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Yonsei University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Lee, SJ (corresponding author), Red Cross Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea.",lsj1109@yahoo.co.kr,,"Lee, Hyeonkyeong/0000-0001-9558-7737","Academy of International Leadership Development, University of Illinois College of Nursing","Academy of International Leadership Development, University of Illinois College of Nursing","We thank Kevin Grandfield for editorial assistance.

The presence of Korean Peninsula slaves in Tang China fundamentally stemmed from the Tang Dynasty's endeavour to re-establish a Sinocentric political order in East Asia. During the eighth to ninth centuries, the substantial profits from slave trading attracted both pirates and Tang officials to participate in the trafficking of Korean Peninsula inhabitants. The severe climatic crisis further amplified the scale of slave trading, characterized by a transformation from 'political captivity' to 'economic captivity'. Although the Tang government promulgated edicts to abolish slave trading in the early ninth century, these measures more closely resembled royal dispensation rather than genuine abolition and notably did not encompass all Korean Peninsula slaves. Through an examination of the emergence and attempted resolution of the Korean Peninsula slave trade during this period, and by drawing comparisons with contemporaneous slave trading practices along the Silk Road, this research contributes to the broader historiography of slave trade development, discussing political authority, economic interests, and humanitarian considerations in medieval East Asia.","[Lin, Zejie; Wang, Yuanlin] Univ Guangzhou, Fac Humanities, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Waihuan West Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangzhou University,"Wang, YL (corresponding author), Univ Guangzhou, Fac Humanities, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Waihuan West Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lzj@gzhu.edu.cn; yuanlin_wang_gzhu@126.com,,,,,,,50,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-039X,1743-9523,,SLAVERY ABOLIT,Slavery Abolit.,2025 MAR 18,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/0144039X.2025.2478550,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0144039X.2025.2478550,,MAR 2025,25,History,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History,0KP8H,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001449614000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data were collected from a convenient sampling of 321 Korean parents and 294 children using the case statements developed by Giovannoni and Becerra (1979). The statements consisted of examples of child neglect in the following seven domains: (I) emotional neglect; (2) lack of supervision; (3) medical neglect; (4) educational neglect; (5) neglect of personal hygiene; (6) nutritional neglect; and, (7) drug/alcohol use. Findings showed that both Korean parents and children consider child neglect moderately serious while Korean children consider child neglect situations significantly more serious. Korean parents perceive emotional neglect as the most serious child neglect domain whereas Korean children perceive drug/alcohol use as the most serious domain of child neglect. Gender variation among Korean children indicates that girls are more likely to perceive the emotional neglect and lack of supervision domains more seriously than boys. The implications of the study offer valuable insights into policy development and program planning efforts in reducing the child neglect among Korean parents and children. Additionally, the findings of the study will likely contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of child neglect among Korean children and parents.

This article attempts to reconstruct Korean perceptions of Britain by analysing a total of 565 articles from six major daily newspapers from between 1920 and 1999 that address British materials, merchandise, brands, consumption patterns and related aspects. The image of Britain embedded in material culture as portrayed in Korean newspapers reflected aspects of Korean-British dynamics that were far more diverse and multivalent than indicated by common diplomatic concepts or textbooks. This study has shown that while Britain was largely viewed as a role model for modernisation in Korea, its image underwent a series of transformations in which its authority as an influential country was often challenged. From the late nineteenth century onwards, British goods were circulated in Korean markets. These goods enjoyed considerable popularity among Korean consumers throughout the twentieth century. Burberry especially stands as an exceptional case as it penetrated deeply into Korean daily life. Burberry was often used as a generic pronoun, and acquired unique prestige as a royal-approved British brand, a favourite target for counterfeit manufacturers and a symbol of high social status.","[Sul, Heasim] Yonsei Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Sul, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,142,0,0,0,7,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND",2043-8567,2043-8575,,BRIT WORLD,Br.

In this Special Section, the article analyzes the ongoing debate in South Korea over the government's policy toward North Korea in regard to these two issues. It argues that uncertainties about these two major issues are shaping the regional order in East Asia. In particular, the different levels of cooperation between South Korea and the United States may affect the regional security order in East Asia. In analyzing policy options available to South Korea, the riskiest option would be to employ early preemptive attacks and accelerate the collapse of North Korea given the security dilemma-driven actionreaction in East Asia. Given that the role of China has become the most crucial factor in dealing with North Korea, the most promising strategy would be to reinforce guarantees of extended nuclear deterrence and prompt a soft-landing unification.","[Chang, Kiyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Choongkoo] Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Chang, K (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",kychang1@snu.ac.kr,"; Lee, Choongkoo/AIA-4059-2022","Lee, Choongkoo/0000-0002-5628-8459;",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046903],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",The Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [grant number NRF-2015S1A3A2046903].,,42,6,7,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-2748,1470-1332,,PAC REV,Pac.

In particular, no existing study has paid attention to the honorific system of Korean, which is one of the most important features in learning the Korean language. In order to address the research gap, this qualitative case study explores how four-year-old, Korean-English bilingual children utilize Korean and English and Korean honorifics depending on social contexts. With a sociocultural theoretical framework, data were collected for seven months by observations, interviews, children's artifacts, and audio- recordings, and analyzed based on thematic and sociolinguistic analysis. The results suggest that dual-language learning for early bilingual learners is a dynamic social and cultural process, involving multilayered decision-making. The findings of this study will be beneficial not only for early bilingual educators but also for the broader community of educators who are interested in the social nature of learning.","[Kim, So Jung] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Teacher Educ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Kim, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Teacher Educ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",skim7@utep.edu,,,,,,,44,4,7,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

The data were collected from in-depth individual interviews with 22 Korean early study abroad undergraduates and 10 of their parents, and the collected data were analyzed using critical discourse analysis (Gee, An introduction to discourse analysis: theory and method, 2011). The findings showed that both participant groups perceived Korean ethnic identity in relation to English, appearance, and nationality. However, while the Korean early study abroad undergraduates demonstrated heterogeneous Korean ethnic identity that was influenced by learning English and embracing American culture, their parents believed that their children's Korean ethnic identity was as unchangeable as their Korean faces and passports. The traditional Korean ethnic identity of the Korean early study abroad undergraduates was challenged by their transnational experiences in a way that admitted the partialness of Korean ethnic identity and expanded the notion to be more inclusive. This intergenerational gap in Korean ethnic identity is expected to explain Korean ethnic identity in relation to transnationalism in more nuanced way.","Hanyang Univ, Dept English Educ, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Lee, MW (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept English Educ, 12-406 Haengdang Dong, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",ppohi@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,52,3,9,2,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0119-5646,2243-7908,,ASIA-PAC EDUC RES,Asia-Pac.

The findings support the basic premise of disposition theory that the development of strong dispositions towards characters is needed in order to develop emotional responses necessary for successful dramas.

During this time, Japanese used translated and published Korean classical novels to learn and understand the Korean language and culture. The first person who transcribed Korean classical novels was Amenomori Hoshu, an interpreter who also learned the Korean language by transcribing classical novels such as Sukhyangjeon (The Tale of Sukhyang) and Yi Baek-gyeong jeon (The Tale of Yi Baek-gyeong). He also used Korean classical novels when he was teaching Korean to Japanese apprentices training to become interpreters. Korean classical novels were used continuously as Korean learning materials by Japanese scholars, interpreters, students, and so on. As the interest in Korean classical novels increased, Choe Chung jeon (The Tale of Choe Chung), Im Gyeong-eop jeon (The Tale of Im Gyeong-eop), and Chunhyangjeon (The Tale of Chunhyang), among others, were translated and published. Scholars such as Nakarai Tosui, Takahashi Toru, and Hosoi Hajime continued to translate Korean classical novels. These scholars also published several classical novels up until the 1920s. They contain a total of 15 pieces, which are representative examples of Korean classical novels. Hosoi claimed that learning Korean classical novels was important to learning more about the Joseon dynasty. After receiving Korean classical novels through the transcription, translation, and publication process, Japanese scholars studied them earnestly. This article systematically traces this early period when Korean classical novels first became the subject of study among Japanese.","Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Cha, CH (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul, South Korea.",cc6410@hanmail.net,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,4,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SUM,2013,53,2,,,,,155,180,,,,,,26,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,184ZY,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000321936000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

As soon as different events have forced a cultural shift, the historical changes are considered important for music analysis. The research examines the court music of China, Japan and Korea in the 16th-17th centuries. Special attention is paid to the main characteristics, similarities and differences of music in these states. Moreover, a comparative analysis of court music in different countries was made. The purpose was to investigate the stages of the court music development, explored the historical and social events that influenced the shift in musical genres, and identified similarities and differences between musical art in different countries. The research discusses the contact between Chinese, Korean, Japanese and European cultures and its impact on the development of court music. Moreover, the research identifies similar and different characteristics found in classical musical genres such as nanxi drama (theatre) common in China, fairy tale singing popular in Japan, and ceremonial music performed in Korea. In the Far East countries, court music had features of both ceremonial and epic music associated with great orchestras with a wide variety of instruments. The musical instruments had many common features. The materials used to make the instruments and the production cycles were similar. Many instruments had analogues in other countries. The Chinese guzheng had many similar features with Japanese koto and Korean kayagum; pipa (China) is similar to biwa (Japan). Many instruments migrated from one country to another. The shakuhachi musical instrument moved from China to Japan and became very popular in this country. The music instrument was created in about 20 shapes and sizes to make distinctive sounds. Further research should consider other aspects that influenced the development of cultural values and court music in China, Japan and Korea. It is important to analyse other cultural changes and trends to understand the societal transformations, values and characteristics of the Far East countries.","[Guo, Linlin] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Korean Mus, Jeonju, South Korea; [Guo, Linlin] PingDingShan Univ, Dept Mus, Pingdingshan, Peoples R China",Jeonbuk National University; Pingdingshan University,"Guo, LL (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Korean Mus, Jeonju, South Korea.;Guo, LL (corresponding author), PingDingShan Univ, Dept Mus, Pingdingshan, Peoples R China.",linlinguo52@yahoo.com,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,19,UNIV FEDERAL GOIAS,GOIANIA,"Av.

Pachinko is a direct record and testimony of the narrative of Korean -Japanese who is struggling with his or her identity under the discrimination and prejudice that has continued from the past to the present, including the people who wander adrift. In the words of Foucault, we should hold a skeptical view toward ourselves, our present, our appearance and here and today. In this sense, the boundary crossing of Koreans described in Pachinko showcases the potential for enabling readers to critically contemplate violent discrimination in the era of multiculturalism and multiracialism, increasing their understanding of minorities and their cultures, and ultimately acquiring ethical insights from new perspectives. Furthermore, Pachinko can be seen as contents that present the possibility of acquiring ethics by understanding those who are discriminated against in society. This study examines narratives of discrimination and prejudice as they are represented across media in the novel Pachinko and the TV series Pachinko. This study also examines various aspects of life that move toward a decolonizing subject through the struggling life of characters. We interpret the existential aspect of characters as trans -identity and illustrate various aspects of identity transformation of characters that appear in narrative contents. Humans cannot be free from their ethical and identity related anxieties through the past, present and future. We are sure that literature, or content can continue to play a role that criticizes and supports those anxieties.","[Oh, Sojeong] Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea; [Oh, Sojeong] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Foreign Studies, Seoul 02450, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Oh, S (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea.;Oh, S (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Foreign Studies, Seoul 02450, South Korea.",osj@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,KNOWLEDGE HUB PUBL CO LTD,HONG KONG,"AMTEL BUILDING, 148 DES VOEUX ROAD CENTRAL, HONG KONG, 00000, HONG KONG",2520-4920,2616-4566,,INTERDISCIP STUD LIT,Interdiscip.

This article argues that for newly-arrived North Koreans the failure at state level does not mean they are entirely cast adrift, as religious and secular institutions within civil society are shouldering more of the burden of adaptation for the newcomers.

Among them is Bulgasari, an iron-eating monster, which will be the main topic of this paper. The monster's name Bulgasari has a paradoxical meaning in Korean, which is cannot be killed but can be killed by fire. The meaning of the name represents the wide gamut of ambivalent identity ranging from physical to metaphorical aspects of the monster. It also provides a uniquely Korean reception and interpretation of being monstrous as distinctive from the archetypal imagery and general understanding of monstrosity as enduring evil, as seen in most myths and tradition. For instance, Bulgasari's destructive power is frequently portrayed in the myth as a heroic trait to protect social justice by condemning and punishing the evils of society. Such an ambivalent identity as both monster and hero shows that Bulgasari's embodiment of monstrosity is recognized through a different or rather complex mechanism in Korean-specific context, not uniformly recognized as enduring evil. This study traces historical descriptions of the monster Bulgasari in legend, literature, and film adaptation. Especially focusing on the North Korean film Bulgasari (1985), this study explores the way in which the ambivalent identity of the monster develops into discourses of humanity and pacifism, in both Korean- specific and transnational contexts, while mirroring the Korean and global sense of reality situated in this era of South-North division and nuclear holocaust.","[Park, Jungman] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Sch English Interpretat & Translat, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Park, J (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Sch English Interpretat & Translat, Seoul, South Korea.",jungmany@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,2,ATENEO DE MANILA UNIV,QUEZON CITY,"SCH HUMANITIES, DEPT ENGLISH, LOYOLA HEIGHTS, QUEZON CITY, 1108, PHILIPPINES",2094-6937,,,KRIT KULT,Krit.

In order to address the growing concern about the issue, Japan's National Diet passed an anti-hate speech law in 2016. While some legal actions have been taken as a result and there has been some recent academic research into the social production of hate speech, relatively little effort has been made to investigate how the targeted group understands and deals with this form of hostility. Our aim here is to document the ways in which young Koreans who have been living in Japan for greater or lesser lengths of time perceive the rise in hate speech directed against them there and their strategies for coping with it. We explore these issues through an analysis of in-depth interviews with 14 young Koreans, for we seek to shift the focus of hate speech away from the act and toward its targets.","[Ahn, Ji-Hyun] Univ Washington, Commun, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA; [Park, Hyewon] Univ Tokyo, Dept Adv Social & Int Studies, Tokyo, Japan",University of Washington; University of Washington Tacoma; University of Tokyo,"Ahn, JH (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Commun, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA.",jhahn01@uw.edu; faintkaia44@gmail.com,,"park, hyewon/0000-0003-1654-6297; Ahn, Ji-Hyun/0009-0007-6345-800X",Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2017-R48]; University of Washington Tacoma,Academy of Korean Studies; University of Washington Tacoma(University of Washington),This research was funded by a Research Grant from the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2017-R48) and a Scholarship and Teaching Fund from the University of Washington Tacoma (2017-2018).,,40,6,6,0,25,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1568-4849,1568-5314,,ASIAN J SOC SCI,Asian J.

This paper explores the reframing process in the local context of Cheju Island. Cheju is an interesting region for this research. Its dominant indigenous religions and a historical uprising against Catholics made it highly resistant to the Christian mission. However, Cheju emerged as the most receptive place for the spread of Christianity through its accommodation of North Korean Christian refugees during the Korean War. My analysis argues that the outbreak of the Cheju Massacre in 1948 and the influence of the North Korean Christian refugees that arrived on Cheju during the subsequent Korean War had a critical influence on changing the Cheju locals' view of Christianity from that of an unwanted foreign power to an instrument for fighting communism. Despite the conflicts that arose with the Christian refugees, those refugees' influence on the lives of the locals led to a multi-layered acceptance of Christianity. Christianity was viewed as a gracious savior, the means to political authority, and an entry to modern western culture and commerce.","[Gwon, Gwisook] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, Jeju, South Korea",Jeju National University,"Gwon, G (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, Jeju, South Korea.",ggsoog@hanmail.net,,,,,,,42,1,2,0,7,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

By examining late nineteenth-century British newspaper articles that discuss Korea, this study reveals the image of Korea held by the British people during that time, and the ways in which this image emerged. First of all, articles discussing Korea's political and social situation-namely, the king, government officials, and the working and living conditions of people-are reviewed. Secondly, we examine descriptions in these articles of what may loosely be called the cultural domain, which includes clothing, religion, and customs, for example. Finally, British newspaper accounts of Korea's relations with China and Japan are analyzed. Through a systematic examination of the way Korea was depicted by British newspapers, the most popular source of information in late nineteenth-century British society, this study ultimately attempts to show that the image of Korea that they sketched was framed by Orientalist assumptions and based on their knowledge of the relatively familiar Chinese and Japanese.","[Yoon, Jong-pil; Park, Hyun-sook] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Park, HS (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jpyoon1982@gmail.com; hspark@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,45,4,4,1,15,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,FAL,2014,54,3,,,,,33,59,,,,,,27,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,AQ1KT,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000342541000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It also examines the influence of rice on Korean politics and reviews the U.S. military occupation policy in Korea. This paper stresses that USAMGIK's rice policy underwent trials and errors and ended in failure. Because former Japanese food controls had broken down, the American military government inaugurated a new rice policy, establishing a free market in rice in October 1945. Unfortunately, the attempted establishment of the free market led to complete disaster. The shortage of rice was evident throughout the country. The American military government had not only rescinded the free market, but had ordered rice rationing. The disastrous shortage of rice in South Korea caused Soviet U.S. relations on the Korean peninsula to deteriorate. The worsening food situation forced the American military government to revive the old Japanese rice collection system in January 1946. Because of its overwhelming importance in Korean life and the bad practices involved in its collection, rice exerted a great influence on South Korean domestic politics. In sum, one of the greatest failures of U.S. military occupation policy in Korea had to do with rice policy.","Kyungpook Natl Univ, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU),"Jinwung, K (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, 1370 Sankyuk Dong, Taegu 702701, South Korea.",jwukim@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,0,1,0,1,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SUM,2007,47,2,,,,,208,231,,,,,,24,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,201RO,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000248850500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results suggest that knowledge of both types of plural developed with increasing proficiency. However, the features associated with the intrinsic plural, which is more similar to the English plural in terms of grammatical function, were more easily acquired than those of the extrinsic (distributive) plural, which requires recruiting the features of a completely distinct morpholexical item from the first language (L1).

As a non-nuclear power, South Korea faces difficulty in developing effective countermeasures against the nuclear threat from the North.

An increasing number of South Koreans advocate nuclear armament of their country, either by redeploying US tactical nuclear weapons or by developing an indigenous nuclear capability. Support for going nuclear reflects three beliefs: nuclear weapons can serve as a shield from external bullying, the balance of power between Seoul and Pyongyang has shifted due to Pyongyang's growing nuclear capability, and possessing nuclear weapons is the sole way to protect ROK national interests given growing skepticism over the credibility of the US nuclear umbrella. I revisit deterrence theory to demonstrate that these perceptions are based on the flawed assumption that nuclear weapons can only be deterred by other nuclear weapons. This assumption-an extrapolation from the Cold War experience-does not consider technological breakthroughs made since then. In fact, modern, technologically advanced conventional weapons can also deter nuclear weapons, especially those using relatively underdeveloped technologies. By continuously modernizing its conventional weapons and strengthening the ROK-US alliance, South Korea can deter Pyongyang from contemplating a nuclear assault on South Korea.","[Son, Daekwon] Peking Univ, Int Relat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Son, Daekwon] Pacific Forum CSIS 2017, Honolulu, HI USA",Peking University,"Son, D (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Int Relat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",son.daekwon@sovip.org,,,Korea Foundation fellowship at Pacific Forum,Korea Foundation fellowship at Pacific Forum,"The author would like to thank Wang Dong, Mei Ran, Peter Hayes, Chung-in Moon, Jaewoo Choo, Yang Xiangfeng, and Jung Nam Lee for their support and comments on the earlier draft of this article.

It stresses that the process of integrating NK migrants through the social enterprise model leads to apprehend this question, not in the traditional framework of policies specific to NK migrants, but in a broader framework to address a more comprehensive issue of the integration of vulnerable populations. This is an orientation that breaks with the previous public-policy framework towards NK migrants without real counterpart benefits. This approach also supplements governmental policies that have been developed since 2005 to encourage NK migrants to engage in skills training and support programmes in employment coaching. By adding case studies that assess the effectiveness of NK migrants' work integration based on the criteria of job creation, job skills enhancement, and normal job sustenance, this study examines whether the European-originated work integration social enterprise model works for a particular social enterprise type benefiting NK migrants in South Korea.","[Bidet, Eric] Univ Maine, Fac Law Econ & Business Adm, Le Mans, France; [Jeong, Bok Gyo] Kean Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Union, NJ USA",Le Mans Universite; Kean University,"Bidet, E (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Fac Law Econ & Business Adm, Le Mans, France.",Eric.Bidet@univ-lemans.fr,"Bidet, Eric/JWQ-0444-2024","BIDET, ERIC/0000-0002-2434-0582",,,,,23,1,2,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-9775,1469-3631,,CONTEMP POLIT,Contemp.

Numerous bone needles, stone needles, and other medical devices were found in the Xiaoyingzi excavation. The stone needles from Xiaoyingzi can be categorized into three grades, based on length, of 8cm, 12-15cm, and 18cm. A set of round stones for massage were also discovered, along with obsidian blades. These relics were carefully stored in the middle of the body in the stone coffin. In addition to Xiaoyingzi, stone needles were also excavated along the lower valley region of the Tuman (Tumen) River. These facts indicate that the owner was involved in medical practice, and that medical procedures using stone needles were quite popular at the time. This article carefully investigates that the relics have nothing to do with weaving textile or military use. Current research on the origin of acupuncture has been confined either to stone needles from the prehistoric age or to bronze needles, as well as to literature from the Warring States period to the Han China, during which acupuncture technology was considerably expanded. However, substantial knowledge on the gap between stone needles and metal needles has been procured through the analysis of Xiaoyingzi, Yanji. The findings of Xiaoyingzi are also significant in providing a more detailed reconstruction of the development of acupuncture in East Asia and emergence of acupuncture throughout history. A large amount of medical items (stone and bone needles, cases for needles, massage stone type bianshi, and etc.), have been excavated from Xiaoyingzi and other neighbouring sites, Along with geographic and ecological factors, this archeological data strongly suggests the medical tradition of using acupuncture needles was practiced around Tumen River basin in the Bronze Age (10th century B.C.).","[Kang, In Uk; Cha, Wung Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Kang, IU (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",kanginuk@khu.ac.kr; chawung@khu.ac.kr,"Cha, Wung/AAK-2422-2020; Kang, In/AAI-2868-2020","Kang, In Uk/0000-0002-4549-1267",Kyung Hee University,Kyung Hee University,This work was supported by a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2013,,5,0,0,0,6,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"SEOUL NAT UNIV, DEPT MED HIST, COLL MED, 28 YEONGEON-DONG, JONGRO-GU, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

We argue that the participatory elements of the anticipatory transitional justice efforts are necessarily transnational and must be focused on enabling conditions for a future transition scenario. Political opportunity structures, particularly those shaped by the South Korean state, are critical in facilitating victim engagement. Our findings contextualize the purpose of anticipatory efforts and highlight ways to better address challenges faced by victim constituencies.

Similarly, the modernization of South Korea has put its citizens, corporations, and soldiers out into the world and raised their exposure to traditional non-state (Islamic, nationalist, and so on) terrorism. Yet South Korea's two national security strategies to date scarcely touch on the issue, while Korea's foremost security journal, the Korean Journal of Defense Analysis, has only published a handful of articles on the topic. Hence, this article seeks to place terrorism more coherently within South Korea's growing grand strategy debate. It argues that Northern provocations fit within post-9/11 thinking about terrorism, and that South Koreans are targets of opportunity in the current salafist terror wave due to their alliance with America, Protestant evangelization overseas, and status as Buddhists, Confucians, or Christians in jihadists' clash of civilizations mindset. Terrorism event counts against South Koreans, including fatalities, are quantitatively presented. The totals are low, so the threat, while new, is middling, not existential. South Korea need not overreact as America arguably did to 9/11. Policies such as moderate homeland security measures, distance from expansive U.S. goals in the war on terror, and a wariness of Middle Eastern engagements are recommended.","[Kelly, Robert E.] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Pusan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Kelly, RE (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Pusan, South Korea.",robertkelly260@hotmail.com,,,Fund for Humanities & Social Studies at Pusan National University,Fund for Humanities & Social Studies at Pusan National University,"This study was supported by the Fund for Humanities & Social Studies at Pusan National University, 2016.

Mass schooling transforms students into national citizens belonging to specific nation-states, an exercise particularly important for both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. To gain insight into how these nations envision their ideal citizens and use national education for legitimisation, we analyze elementary school textbooks as data points for the respective Koreas. We find that North and South Korea define two separate and distinct national identities for their students, focussing more on the institutional differences between the two states than on their shared cultural and ethnic heritage.

Allen; William F. Griffis,,"Most of the World Expositions hosted by industrialized Western nations between the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century served as cultural tools for imperialism, platforms for social Darwinism, and show windows for Orientalist discourse. At the same time the World Expositions represented golden opportunities for less developed Asian countries to establish relationships with the emerging international community and to (re)position themselves in a changing regional and world order. This article argues that those Asian countries were not passive and innocent victims of colonizers but active participants who negotiated and contested with Western powers in the process of their nation-state-building and modernization efforts. Keeping the dualistic nature of World Expositions in mind, this study reappraises the process, characteristics, and historical legacy of the Korean participation at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. What were some of the typical (mis)perceptions of Westerners toward fin de siecle Korean people and culture, and vice-versa? What kind, if any, clash of civilizations occurred at the Exposition between Western materialism and the Confucian world view? To what extent was Korea's experience in Chicago unique as well as universal in comparison with that of other Asian countries? In addressing these questions, this study focuses more on narrating an alternative version of world history based on Korea's experience than on providing another version of modern Korean history. Avoiding the so-called global parochialism, this article uncovers the conflicts and rivalries among Asian countries during the Columbian Exposition.","Chung Ang Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"YoungSoo, Y (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",Waldo@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,62,2,4,0,3,KYUJANGGAK INST KOREAN STUD,"SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU","NO 103, SAN 56-1, SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0201,2331-4826,,SEOUL J KOREAN STUD,Seoul J.

Alarmed by recent social and demographic changes, the Korean government has started to establish explicit family policies from the mid 2000s. These policies have signified a symbolic attention shift to family matters in the history of social policy in Korea. In this paper, we focus on three areas of family policy: (a) work-family policies, (b) a healthy family policy, and (c) a policy for multi-cultural families. Work-family policies aim to help working families with young children balance work responsibilities and family caregiving through multiple leave options and child care support. The Framework Act on Healthy Families, the first explicit family policy in Korea, requires local governments to provide family services through Healthy Family Support Centers. The Multi-Cultural Family Support Act also established a formal support system for multi-cultural families with immigrant spouses, a population group that has recently increased in Korea. We further discuss the domestic and comparative contexts of Korean family policy and provide suggestions for the remaining challenges.","[Lee, Jaerim] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Family & Housing Studies, Kyeongbuk 712749, South Korea; [Chin, Meejung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Child Dev & Family Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Soyoung] Montclair State Univ, Dept Family & Child Studies, Montclair, NJ USA; [Son, Seohee] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Family & Resource Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Sung, Miai] Korea Natl Open Univ, Dept Home Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Yeungnam University; Seoul National University (SNU); Montclair State University; Sookmyung Women's University; Korea National Open University,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Family & Housing Studies, Kyeongbuk 712749, South Korea.",jrlee@yu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Soyoung/0000-0001-5731-9395; Lee, Jaerim/0000-0002-3328-9117",,,,,42,46,48,1,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1062-1024,,,J CHILD FAM STUD,J.

J,"Martin, CH",,,,"Martin, Curtis H.",,,Barack Obama and North Korea: A Study in Presidential Transition,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korea nuclear program; US policy on the North Korean nuclear program; Barack Obama; presidential transitions and foreign policy; engagement; sanctions,,"This study will examine the policy of the incoming administration of Barack Obama toward North Korea's nuclear program as a case-study in presidential transitions. Obama did not give much prominence to North Korea during the campaign, but he clearly framed the talks on the DPRK nuclear question in the broader contexts of promoting international law, strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and pursuing broad multilateral diplomacy. Furthermore, he laid out simple but clear policy guidelines. The USA would engage the DPRK and remain open to positive incentives for denuclearization. On the other hand, the DPRK would receive no material incentives simply for returning to the Six-Party Talks, would have to meet its existing obligations before new incentives could be offered, and could not expect bilateral talks outside the context of the Six-Party Talks. The two-track policy of diplomatic engagement and sanctions that had emerged by the end of the presidential transition closely conformed to the general guidelines that Obama had laid out in the campaign. The administration pressed successfully for new UN sanctions and resumed enforcement of the UN ban on weapons shipments that had been allowed to lapse under Bush. These actions were intended, however, to complement, not supplant, an engagement strategy. Throughout his first year in office, Obama continued actively to seek resumption of dialogue, culminating in the bilateral talks of December 2009. When judged against the lessons of the transition literature, the administration's success in formulating a coherent North Korea policy comes out reasonably well. The six months it took to complete assembling a full team was within normal bounds for a new administration. The appointment of a talented mix of loyalists, holdovers, worthies and all-stars to the North Korea team provided a variety of experience and perspectives and positioned the administration well for either engagement or increased pressure. US policy reflected the diverse experiences and outlooks of the North Korea team. If the Six-Party Talks resume, Obama's resolve to hold firm to his demands will be tested by the same problems that his recent predecessors confronted.","Merrimack Coll, N Andover, MA 01845 USA",Merrimack College,"Martin, CH (corresponding author), Merrimack Coll, N Andover, MA 01845 USA.",,,,,,,,64,2,5,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

In the political arena, the Framework Agreement has provided a major platform for promoting EU-Korea political dialogue and developing a common stance toward a shared global agenda. When it comes to security, the main agenda involves North Korea's missiles, nuclear program, and the challenge of nonproliferation; the two parties have coordinated sanctions against North Korea. South Korea has enacted a Crisis Management Participation Agreement (FPA) with the EU and begun to participate in the EU common security and defence policy. The changing security environment on the Korean Peninsula, as a consequence of recent inter-Korean and US-North Korea dialogues, may offer the EU new opportunities for constructive engagement. In the economic arena, the EU-Korea FTA has established solid trade and investment relations. While these pillars of the strategic partnership have led to stable and mature bilateral relations, both the EU and South Korea need to find new momentum for an enhanced partnership to deal with the ongoing challenge of global security instability and the backlash against the liberal international order. The EU-South Korea strategic partnership also needs a global agenda that covers climate change, technology, education, and culture. This study assesses the development of each pillar of the strategic partnership, addressing key challenges, tasks, and future diplomatic developments between the EU and South Korea.","[Chung, Sae Won] Korea Univ, KU KIEP SBS EU Ctr, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lee, Jae-Seung] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Lee, JS (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",swchung37@korea.ac.kr; jaselee@korea.ac.kr,"CHUNG, Sae Won/AAE-8812-2019; Lee, Sang/B-1029-2013","Chung, Sae Won/0000-0001-7391-6368",,,,,47,8,8,1,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1610-2932,1612-1031,,ASIA EUR J,Asia Eur.

The originators and most influential promoters of the predominance were Rev. Chai-choon Kim (1901-1987) and Dr Jong-sung Rhee (1922-2011), the theological and denominational leaders of the more or less liberalist Korean Presbyterian churches. Both of them went almost the same theological way: After getting to know Karl Barth and his dominance in Japan and deepening their knowledge of Barthian theology in the USA, they fought against the Korean Presbyterian churches' conservative, Old Princeton theology on the basis of Barthian theology. Having witnessed the notorious conflicts and schisms of the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK), both Kim and Rhee presupposed that the principal culprit of the conflicts and schisms was the conservative, Old Princeton (Reformed Orthodox) theology that the American Presbyterian Korea missionaries had successfully planted in Korean Presbyterian churches. So in order to attack the missionaries' theology as well as to justify their liberalist theology, both Kim and Rhee profoundly accepted the Barthian triumph frame: the Reformed Orthodoxy of the 17(th) and 18(th) centuries was defeated by the liberalism of the 19(th) century, which was, in turn, overcome by the Barthian Neo-Orthodoxy of the 20(th) century. Although the frame itself has recently been proved to be unfounded, both Kim and Rhee blindly accepted it and led their numerous followers to throw out both the missionaries and their Old Princeton theology. Nevertheless, Kim and Rhee 'threw the baby out with the bathwater'; they led the next generation to be deprived of its own Reformed history, whose living legacy has been the missionaries' Reformed Orthodoxy and Old Princeton theology. On the other hand, having accepted Barthian theology enthusiastically, both Kim and Rhee exploited it mainly to condemn the missionaries' theology, ending up failing to integrate it into their own theologies.","[Hwang, Jae-Buhm] Keimyung Univ, Daegu, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Hwang, JB (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Daegu, South Korea.",jbhwang@kmu.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0014-5246,1745-5308,,EXPOSITORY TIMES,Exposit.

Drawing on Oppenheimer's theory of marriage and review of changing educational and economic contexts of Korean men, we develop a hypothesis on growing educational differentials in marriage. We find that the high educated delay marriage until later ages but catch up to the extent to which they are eventually more likely to marry than the low educated. There is a continued trend across cohorts toward the delay and avoidance of marriage at all educational levels. However, the trend of retreat from marriage has been more substantial for men with high school or less education compared to men with a university degree, leading to growing educational gaps over time in marriage. Among the three cohorts, the youngest cohort, among which low educated men's economic prospects have particularly deteriorated due to rapid educational expansion and economic crisis, shows most pronounced decline in marriage.

Methods: Data were obtained from 228,642 participants, of whom 6,372 had asthma, who participated in the 2013 Korean Community Health Survey. We explored the risk of falls after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for falls in asthmatics. Patients with asthma who had been diagnosed by a physician were included after excluding those who did not respond to the self-reported questionnaire. Results: In all, 1,733/6,372 (27.1%) asthma patients and 258/788 (32.7%) patients with uncontrolled asthma (who had visited the emergency room because of asthma exacerbation in the prior 12months) reported histories of falls. In asthmatics, the crude odds ratio (OR) for falls was 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48-1.67); the OR for falls in the group with uncontrolled asthma was 2.13 (95% CI: 1.83-2.47). The multivariate OR for falls in the asthma group (compared to the non-asthma group) was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.18-1.35) and the OR for falls in the uncontrolled asthma group (again compared to the non-asthma group) was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.32-1.82). Subgroup analysis of the adjusted ORs for falls in asthmatics by age group revealed a significant difference between the presence of asthma and uncontrolled asthma, and falls, in each age group, similar to the relationship evident in the total adult population. Conclusion: Asthma is associated with falls, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and comorbid variables.","[Chung, Jae Ho] Catholic Kwandong Univ, Coll Med, Int St Marys Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Incheon, South Korea; [Kim, Tae Ho] Seoul Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Chang Hoon] Natl Hlth Insurance Serv Ilsan Hosp, Dept Internal Med, 100 Isan Ro, Goyang Shi, Kyunggi Do, South Korea",Catholic Kwandong University; Seoul Medical Center; National Health Insurance Service,"Han, CH (corresponding author), Natl Hlth Insurance Serv Ilsan Hosp, Dept Internal Med, 100 Isan Ro, Goyang Shi, Kyunggi Do, South Korea.",hch7001@hanmail.net,"Chung, Jae/W-3109-2017","Kim, Tae Ho/0000-0002-3720-8011",,,,,29,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0277-0903,1532-4303,,J ASTHMA,J.

Likewise, the existing findings suggest that, given both co-ethnicity and co-nationality, South Koreans are likely to have more positive attitudes toward North Korean defectors than other types of immigrants. However, in this paper, we present a different perspective to analyse South Koreans' attitudes toward North Korean defectors by taking the role of partisanship into account. Using an original survey experiment, we found that when the liberal incumbent government emphasises the inclusion of North Korean defectors, conservative partisans' attitudes become negative. In particular, this partisan bias appears with regard to ethnic national identity, but not to civic national identity. Conversely, under the same condition, liberals' attitudes do not change positively. Based on the findings, we conclude that South Koreans' attitudes toward North Korean defectors are related to negative partisanship.","[Kim, Gidong] Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO USA; [Lee, Jae Mook] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Na Kyeong] Seoul Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Seoul Women's University,"Lee, NK (corresponding author), Seoul Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",nalee@swu.ac.kr,"; Kim, Gidong/KHV-2107-2024","Lee, Jaemook/0000-0003-3873-3085; Kim, Gidong/0000-0003-4502-0876",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2020S1A5C2A03093177]; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; Seoul Women's University [2022-0154],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; Seoul Women's University","\Jae Mook Lee acknowledges that this work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF2020S1A5C2A03093177), and this paper was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund.

I emphasize the differences between the two anti-Americanisms in terms of their respective discursive origins. Land of Excrement was reprinted in a North Korean Communist Party bulletin without the author's permission, and he was arrested in 1965.

The cointegration test proposed by Banerjee. Do ludo, and Mestre (1998) is appropriate for a cointegration test with a small sample size. This paper applies the ordinary least squares estimation using the first differenced variables, and examines the impact of the relative price, world income, and duty drawbacks as export subsidies on export demand.

It begins by retracing the citational relay of Korean women's decolonial provocations via the 1977 Frontiers publication of an essay written by Japanese feminist journalist Yayori Matsui. It then moves to a feminist translational reading of a 2021 Korean-language publication featuring twelve life stories of women from the Korean diaspora, which demonstrate their multilingual and multi-vocal heterogeneity. In contrast to their generic and anonymous invocation in 1977, this transnational and translingual relay foregrounds three specific nodes of difference and inequality among Korean women: (1) dispersed genealogies, (2) diverse configurations of social reproduction, and (3) intra-ethnic exploitation.","[Kang, Laura Hyun Yi] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92617, USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Kang, LHY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92617, USA.",,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,0,UNIV NEBRASKA PRESS,LINCOLN,"1111 LINCOLN MALL, LINCOLN, NE 68588-0630 USA",0160-9009,1536-0334,,FRONTIERS,Frontiers-J.

KRongBERT mitigates the out-of-vocabulary issues that arise with byte- pair-encoding tokenizers in Korean and incorporates language-specific embedding layers to enhance understanding. Our model demonstrates up to an 1.56% improvement in performance on specific natural language understanding tasks compared to the traditional BERT implementations. Notably, KRongBERT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art Korean BERT models while utilizing only 11.42% of the data required by other models.

Moreover, many Korean Buddhists see their tradition as an indigenous one, unlike Christianity, which they deem imported. Accordingly, Buddhist representatives from both sides of the DMZ believe that a merger of North and South Korean Buddhism is an essential key to the peninsula's reunification. However, that vision comes up against a number of obstacles. Firstly, no matter how dynamic it is, the Chobulyon , which is the North Korea's sole Buddhist body, has remained subordinate to the Chuch'e sasang (or Juche, Self-Reliance ideology) since its birth in 1972. Secondly, many Southern Christian groups, untroubled by their imported nature, compete fiercely with Buddhists for the religious conquest of the North. Thirdly, two other factors have hampered the efforts made by Southern Buddhists to get closer to their Northern counterparts: the lack of continuity characterizing the reunification policies of the last four Southern presidential administrations; and the Chogyejong's lack of autonomy regarding those policies. Despite these obstacles, Venerable P'opt'a (b. 1945), alias the Bodhisattva of Reunification, maintains that it is imperative to keep engaging North Korean Buddhists as they are, and to keep providing material help to Northerners especially food through Buddhist channels. Doing otherwise would not only be counter to the spirit of universal compassion which typifies Mahayana Buddhism, but also leave Southern Buddhists unprepared in the case of unexpected political changes in P'yongyang.","[Senecal, Bernard] Sogang Univ, Inst Study Relig, Seoul, South Korea; [Senecal, Bernard] Sogang Univ, Dept Religious Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University; Sogang University,"Senécal, B (corresponding author), Sogang Univ, Inst Study Relig, Seoul, South Korea.",senecber@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,57,5,7,0,8,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

The main motivation of expectancy of further education opportunities and success in future career and strategies mainly in establishing Korean sociocultural context for Korean language acquisition are described. The positive attitude of non-Korean families toward Korean language studies highlights the functional importance of Korean language as a means of acquiring a larger benefit from China's economic marketization, especially increasing business contacts with South Korea.

In the past decade, global discussions about North Korean human rights have also come to include these abductions, the final report of the UN Commission of Inquiry in 2014 being a prime example. How did the abductions and North Korean human rights issues become so interconnected? I argue that these issues are mutually constitutive. Japanese state and non-state actors' promotion of the abductions issue at home and abroad benefitted international advocacy for North Korean human rights and led to the integration of the abductions issue into the global North Korean human rights agenda. It also promoted awareness of North Korean human rights in Japan. Original interviews and content analysis of UN resolutions, Japanese media coverage, prime ministers' speeches, and government publications empirically demonstrate the mutual constitution of local and international activists' discursive messages.

This study hypothesizes that some sort of reconciliation process, leading ultimately to reunification, will take place on the Korean Peninsula over the next decade. It postulates that Korean unification would occur without an armed conflict that would poison relations between North and South, and that it would leave the peninsula under the control of Seoul. Unification would give birth to a sizable regional power whether measured by population, industrial capacity, or military capability. The study considers how China would respond to these striking developments. In so doing, it identifies dynamics that would influence China's response, even should unification play out in a less benign fashion than hypothesized here. Viewed from Beijing, a united Korea, especially one that played host to U.S. military and naval forces, could cast a long shadow over China's seaborne commerce, the wellspring of economic vitality for northern China. In recent years it has become abundantly clear that Being will play a crucial role in the future of Korea. Despite the intellectual and policy attention accorded China's role on the peninsula, one factor remains woefully unexplored: the influence of geopolitics on Chinese strategic thought. This essay argues that geopolitics is alive and well in East Asia. China's history will shape its attitude toward Korean unification and impart. a distinct geographical hue to its foreign policy calculations. Beijing will resist the emergence of a pro-American Korea that could imperil China's access to East Asian and Pacific waterways. It will formulate its regional policy and maritime strategy accordingly.","USA, War Coll, Montgomery, AL USA; Inst Foreign Policy Anal, Cambridge, MA USA; Univ Georgia, Ctr Int Trade & Secur, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"USA, War Coll, Montgomery, AL USA.",toshi.yoshihara@maxwell.af.mil; jholmes@uga.edu,"Yoshihara, Toshi/MTA-2365-2025",,,,,,91,4,4,0,13,INST INT RELATIONS,MUCHA,"64 WAN SHOU RD, MUCHA, TAIPEI 00000, TAIWAN",1013-2511,,,ISSUES STUD,Issues Stud.,JUN,2005,41,2,,,,,119,169,,,,,,51,Area Studies; International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations; Government & Law,961WS,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000231693100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The controversy, ostensibly over the care of the foreigners' cemetery and possession of a chapel built to commemorate a century of Protestant Christianity in Korea, is also a conflict over the heritage represented by the missionaries buried in the cemetery. Though missionary graves make up less than a quarter of the graves at Yanghwajin, the cemetery has become a site of heritage for the Korean Protestant Church. As such, the narratives told there hold enormous sway. In this essay I examine the narratives emerging from the controversy, to determine what they say about the role of missionaries in Korean history, the legacy of those missionaries today, and the relationship of the church to Korea's modernization. I argue that these narratives selectively craft the story of early missionaries in response to Korean nationalist historiography in an effort to assert the relevance of the Korean Protestant Church to Korean modernization and historical memory.","Eastern Kentucky Univ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA",Eastern Kentucky University,"Underwood, E (corresponding author), Eastern Kentucky Univ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA.",elizabeth.underwood@eku.edu,,,,,,,38,1,2,0,2,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

The purposes of the KOPIA are to introduce new agricultural technologies by cooperative research and development, and to extend developed technologies to farmers and agricultural businesses. In this paper, the economic effects of the KOPIA are estimated in 23 recipient countries in terms of their production and value-added inducement effect. In doing so, the inter-industry relation analysis method is used with an input-output table for each country from the Eora multi-region input-output (Eora MRIO) database. From the analysis between 2009 and 2017, the production inducement effect (PIE) by the KOPIA in the 23 countries is estimated to total US$99 million, accounting for 1.7 times its total budget of US$58.9 million, and the value-added inducement effect (VIE) in the 13 countries is estimated to total US$23.9 million. More importantly, the PIE and VIE continue to be higher in some countries, and the annual VIE tends to increase in most of the countries. These findings imply that the research-led KOPIA has contributed to agricultural development and further economic growth through inter-industrial relations in the recipients.","[Park, Sauk-Hee] Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Publ Adm, Jibong Ro 43, Gyeonggi Do 14662, Bucheon, South Korea; [Moon, Kwang-Min] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Daehak Ro 99, Daejeon 34134, South Korea",Catholic University of Korea; Chungnam National University,"Park, SH (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Publ Adm, Jibong Ro 43, Gyeonggi Do 14662, Bucheon, South Korea.",nice113@catholic.ac.kr; mkm95@cnu.ac.kr,,"Park, Sauk-Hee/0000-0002-6304-185X; Moon, Kwang-Min/0000-0001-5965-3039",South Korea's Rural Development Administration,South Korea's Rural Development Administration,This work was supported by a policy research grant from South Korea's Rural Development Administration.,,37,4,4,1,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT 1,2019,11,19,,,,,,,5224,10.3390/su11195224,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11195224,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JI5RS,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000493525500083,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of approximately 70 years of speeches on Dokdo by members of Japan's National Diet, this study explores and analyzes how, when, and under what specific domestic political economic contexts Japan has argued for its territorial claim to Dokdo. Various comparative analyses of Dokdo-related speeches by issue areas, speakers, political party affiliations, ruling parties, and Japanese cabinets are conducted to probe the logic behind the Japan's territorial claim over Dokdo. The paper proves that right-wing conservative politicians in Japan tend to use the Dokdo events as a way of boosting cabinet approval ratings and appeal to nationalist sentiments in the hope of diverting citizen attention from socio-economic difficulties.","[Kwon, Edward] Northern Kentucky Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA",Northern Kentucky University,"Kwon, E (corresponding author), Northern Kentucky Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA.",kwone1@nku.edu,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,3,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SUM,2016,47,2,,,,,227,266,,,,,,40,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,DV1VN,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000382710300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Underwood; Shinto shrine rites controversy; Korean Presbyterian Church; George S. McCune; Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy; American Presbyterian mission in Korea,,"For the western missionaries the Shinto shrine rites controversy in colonial Korea was a theological crucible. As the Japanese government began forcing mission schools to attend the Shinto shrine ceremonies, American missionaries from the Presbyterian Church in the USA were divided between fundamentalists and liberals fighting a fierce theological battle over the nature of and participation in the Shinto shrine rites. Horace H. Underwood, President of Chosen Christian College in Seoul, was a leader of the liberal minority party. The fundamentalist majority held that the Shinto shrine ceremonies were religious acts and hence bowing during a Shinto ceremony violated the First Commandment. Underwood was uncomfortable with many religious elements in the Shinto rituals, but nevertheless believed that mere attendance and a bow did not constitute either participation in the ritual or worship of the enshrined beings. He thought that the conservative leaders were dictating other people's conscience.","[Ryu, Dae Young] Handong Univ, Dept Gen Studies, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea",,"Ryu, DY (corresponding author), Handong Univ, Dept Gen Studies, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.",ryudy@handong.edu,,,,,,,37,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0040-5736,2044-2556,,THEOL TODAY,Theol.

Thus, the research and resulting publications launched by Jogye Order's Ministry of Culture in 2003 provide an invaluable and comprehensive survey of the hundreds of Buddhist temples and thousands of related cultural assets lost or damaged during the war. These efforts, however, have faced numerous difficulties. The ROK government made almost no official attempts to survey and catalog the damage sustained by the nation's Buddhist temples during the war or its aftermath. Instead, by necessity, the Jogye Order's surveys rely heavily on firsthand accounts of survivors, many of whom have since passed away, that were recorded often many decades after the war itself. The temple property records compiled by the Japanese Colonial Government likewise provide an important source for Jogye Order researchers in determining which temple assets were destroyed or lost during the conflict. However, in many instances, these records are incomplete or only note the names and numbers of assets that are now lost. Nor are such records insightful regarding what became of such assets but only indicate their current absence. Fortunately, over recent decades, the Jogye Order archivists have invested significant time and effort into digitizing surviving historical records and miscellanea recovered from individual temples.","[Park, Cheonghwan; Kim, Kyungrae] Dongguk Univ, Dept Buddhist Studies, Seoul 04620, South Korea",Dongguk University,"Kim, K (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Dept Buddhist Studies, Seoul 04620, South Korea.",avadana@dongguk.edu; wizkyung@dongguk.edu,,,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2021S1A6A3A01097807]; National Research Foundation of Korea; Department of Buddhist Studies, Dongguk University, Seoul Korea","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Department of Buddhist Studies, Dongguk University, Seoul Korea","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea, grant number NRF-2021S1A6A3A01097807.

It begins by retracing the citational relay of Korean women's decolonial provocations via the 1977 Frontiers publication of an essay written by Japanese feminist journalist Yayori Matsui. It then moves to a feminist translational reading of a 2021 Korean-language publication featuring twelve life stories of women from the Korean diaspora, which demonstrate their multilingual and multi-vocal heterogeneity. In contrast to their generic and anonymous invocation in 1977, this transnational and translingual relay foregrounds three specific nodes of difference and inequality among Korean women: (1) dispersed genealogies, (2) diverse configurations of social reproduction, and (3) intra-ethnic exploitation.","[KANG, LAURA HYUN YI] University of California Irvine, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Irvine; [KANG, LAURA HYUN YI] University of California, Irvine",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Kang, LHY (corresponding author), University of California Irvine, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Irvine.;Kang, LHY (corresponding author), University of California, Irvine.",,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,0,UNIV NEBRASKA PRESS,LINCOLN,"1111 LINCOLN MALL, LINCOLN, NE 68588-0630 USA",0160-9009,1536-0334,,FRONTIERS,Frontiers-J.

This article compares three recent films-Shin Han-sol's Karujigi (2008). Kim Dae-woo's Pangja-jon (2010), and Choi Dong-hoon's Chon Uch'i (2009)-with their inspirations from premodern Korean literature and examines how these traditions have been reimagined for modern Korean audiences. Karujigi retains one of the main characters of the original, Pyon Kangsoe, but replaces his female counterpart with a much more demure and innocent love interest. The film is notable for its inversion of gender roles, but it focuses solely on the first half of the original work, and so much has been lost thematically from the original work that it is almost unrecognizable. Pangja-jon takes Korea's most famous love story, the tale of Ch'unhyang, and puts forth the servant instead of the master as Ch'unhyang's lover. As a result, the idealism of the original is replaced by a more cynical and realistic depiction of Korean society at the time, a depiction that is perhaps more suited to a modern audience. Chan Uch'i is the most faithful to the themes and ideals of its inspiration. Through magic and wizardry, it brings its premodern characters into modern Seoul, showing that, in fact, some things never change, and some themes and principles stand the test of time. The tactics adopted by these writer/directors met with varying degrees of success at the box office, but they show that interest in Korea's literary traditions is still alive and well in Korean film","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Interpretat & Translat, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"La Shure, C (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Interpretat & Translat, Seoul, South Korea.",clashure@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,6,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,DEC 15,2013,16,2,,,,,303,327,,,,,,25,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,299ST,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000330416700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined 1) how KA parents practice KTPV, 2) which virtues KA parents desire to develop, and 3) the changes in the application of KTPV after receiving the Ottuki Parenting Program (OPP). The first phase of the study (Study 1) was a community needs assessment with 22 KA parents (13 Korean Speaking and 9 English Speaking) living in the greater Seattle area. Parents participated in focus group interviews and completed surveys. Results showed that both Korean-speaking parents and English-speaking parents had common perceptions of self-cultivation, responsibility, sacrifice, and respect. However, differences were noted in 8 of 12 virtues including example, patience, authority, attention, teaching, generosity, trust, and devotion. Korean-speaking parents desired to develop example, and generosity, authoritative while English-speaking parents desired to develop example. These findings led to the development of the Ottuki Parenting Program (OPP) for Korean-speaking parents. In study 2, 57 Korean-speaking parents participated in the OPP intervention. Post-intervention results showed a significant increase in the practice of self-cultivation, devotion, patience, authority, respect, and generosity among participants.

The data were gathered from older Koreans aged 60 or over from the two countries (n = 480). The prevalence of volunteering was 23.3% for older Korean immigrants in the United States versus 14.7% for the older Koreans in Korea. This study found that there was a significant relationship between human capital (individual resources) and volunteering in both countries. Education and financial status had a positive relationship with volunteering among older Koreans in both countries. Cultural resources and social resources were the only important predictors of volunteering among older Korean immigrants in the United States. Regarding types of volunteering, older Koreans in both countries were more likely to participate in informal volunteering than formal volunteering. These findings differ somewhat from those reported by previous studies. This study was the first attempt to examine older adults from these two countries with a focus on the correlation between cultural factors, social resources, and volunteering.","[Chang, Miya] Daegu Catholic Univ, Ctr Multicultural Studies, Gyongsan 38430, South Korea",Catholic University of Daegu,"Chang, MY (corresponding author), Daegu Catholic Univ, Ctr Multicultural Studies, Gyongsan 38430, South Korea.",philsaram@cu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [NRF-2019S1A5C2A04083298],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea Grant founded by the Korean Government (NRF-2019S1A5C2A04083298).,,51,3,3,0,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Employing a unique dataset of 2,894 firm-years for the entire manufacturing industries, we find that diversification by Korean firms on average decreases firm value but its effect varies by the type of diversification. While unrelated diversification erodes firm value, related diversification is associated with a non-negative effect on firm value. These valuation effects are more pronounced before the crisis than after the crisis. Our results also show an important role of a firm's affiliation to a large business group, known as chaebols, that related diversification by chaebol-affiliated firms comes with a significant value gain. We further find that the different valuation effects of unrelated and related diversification are closely related to a firm's ownership concentration and financial leverage. Our results are robust to different samples and regression model specifications.","[Lee, Jang Woo] Dong Eui Univ, Coll Commerce & Econ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Pusan 614714, South Korea; [Bae, Sung C.] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Kwon, Taek Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Yeosu, South Korea",Dong-Eui University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; Chonnam National University,"Lee, JW (corresponding author), Dong Eui Univ, Coll Commerce & Econ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Pusan 614714, South Korea.",jangwoo@deu.ac.kr,,,,,,,45,7,11,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-9945,2041-6156,,ASIA-PAC J FINANC ST,Asia-Pac.

We aim to determine whether political party allegiance has transitioned into a pattern of habitual voting in the last ten years.MethodsEmploying a Random Forest model based on machine learning approaches, we examined polling data from the last ten years of Korean presidential elections. Instead of relying on hypothesis-led methods, our analysis emphasizes the intrinsic characteristics of the data to uncover crucial elements affecting voter behavior in each election.ResultsOur results reveal a considerable consistency in voting patterns over the past decade, implying that allegiance to political parties has turned into a habitual behavior. Significant factors affecting voter choices in the 2022 election were also recognized as indicators of election outcomes five and ten years prior.ConclusionThe study reveals that voter behavior in South Korea remains stable despite notable political changes, primarily influenced by habitual elements rather than substantial changes in party loyalty. This suggests that political allegiance has become ingrained as a habitual behavior for Korean voters.","[Lee, Jae-Mook] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Na Kyeong] Seoul Womens Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 01797, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Seoul Women's University,"Lee, NK (corresponding author), Seoul Womens Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 01797, South Korea.",nalee@swu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Jaemook/0000-0003-3873-3085",Seoul Women's University [2024-0061]; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies; Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2024S1A3A2A06046280],Seoul Women's University; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies; Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"Seoul Women's University, Grant/Award Number: 2024-0061; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Grant/Award Number: Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; Research Foundation of Korea, Grant/Award Number: NRF-2024S1A3A2A06046280",,56,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

Many scholars have traditionally categorized them in terms of formality or the level of deference and affection. This approach, however, has paid little attention to how Korean speakers actually 'code-switch' between the two forms in a rather dynamic manner at each turn at talk. More recent studies from a more functional perspective mainly focus on the speaker's side of the interaction. In this study, two separate episodes from a Korean news interview show were analyzed. I first transcribed the data following the conventions in Conversation Analysis, then marked all the endings employed in 1st pair part questions and 2nd pair part answers by who issued it, and in which pair part and with what local context it was issued. It has been argued that different languages employ different linguistic devices to project and reshape identities of the other(s) present in real-time interaction. My analyses show that in the Korean news interview, speakers use the two endings in a highly selective manner to achieve the interactional goal of negotiating the moment -by -moment identities of the listener through ongoing talk.

To do so, it makes three methodological interventions. First, it demonstrates how North Korean writers' own practices of citation can be used to outline the extensive and expanding body of South Korean texts available in the North during this period. Second, it shows how a focus on such references and their changing character allows us to see a shift in the late 1950s and early 1960s: one that enabled a selection of South Korean texts to be reprinted in the North, producing intersecting reading publics. Finally, it demonstrates how an understanding of this changing relationship to South Korean texts illuminates changing writing practices in the North and the hybrid texts linking North and South Korean authorship that they produced. The article thus contends that the 1950s and 1960s mediascapes of the two Koreas must be seen as imbricated rather than isolated entities.","[Kief, I.

The movement, which was created during the Edwardian era to defend and maintain the British Empire, spread internationally in accordance with each nation's disparate political and social needs. From this perspective, the Joseon (Korea's national name during the Japanese colonial period) Boy Scout Movement emerged rapidly as a base for practical anti-imperialist resistance. Within the colonial space of Japanese rule, the boys of Joseon were able to foster physical fitness and masculinity through the Boy Scout Movement, thereby fostering a national consciousness and thus growing as autonomous agents capable of resisting the Japanese Empire. The educational activities of the Boy Scouts functioned as a channel for the proliferation and development of modern physical education and sports culture in Korea.","[Lee, Karam] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Phys Educ, Jinju, South Korea; [Ok, Gwang] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Phys Educ, Cheongju, South Korea",Gyeongsang National University; Chungbuk National University,"Ok, G (corresponding author), Chungbuk Natl Univ, Phys Educ, Cheongju, South Korea.",gwangok@yahoo.com,,,Chungbuk National University Korea National University Development Project (2021),Chungbuk National University Korea National University Development Project (2021),This research was supported by Chungbuk National University Korea National University Development Project (2021).,,85,0,0,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-3367,1743-9035,,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

After liberation of 1945, Korean Studies was institutionalized in colleges. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Korean Studies was characterized by its critical edge originated from a nationalist and Marxist consciousness. Since the democratization movement of 1987, however, Korean Studies has tended to focus on a mocroscopic discourses rather than on so-called big theory. In contemporary Korean Studies, some pioneering scholars raised doubts about the dominant disciplinary boundaries, but they are not reliable in that they are too dependent on the Western postmodernism without serious self-reflection on Korean context. The research methodology and learning attitude of National Studies and Shilhak provides an ideal model for reestablishing interdisciplinary Korean Studies. In order to pursue integrated Korean Studies, researchers should have a cooperative mind and proceed with an integrated viewpoint based on their specialties. They should not only acquire a high level of reading comprehension in literary Chinese, but try to broaden their intellectual perspective by keep paying attention to international academic tendencies. In addition, Korean Studies should not fall into closed professionalism nor be subordinated to the power of the market, capital, and journalism.","Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, HB (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",chillwon@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2006,46,1,,,,,225,242,,,,,,18,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,043DF,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000237578900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Korean lacks lexical stress and it has a phonologized association between the Accentual Phrase (AP) initial segment and intonation. In the experiment, 4speakers read sentences including a two-item list which were designed to elicit either an L or H AP-initial tone. The durational variations, the pitch events at prosodic boundaries, and F-0 span in 32 sentences read neutrally and 64 sentences read with one of the items under focus were analyzed. The results show that the focused constituent consistently initiates a new prosodic phrase. In comparison to the neutrally spoken or defocused counterpart, the focused constituent was more likely to be realized as an Intonational Phrase (IP) in some contexts. Bitonal IP boundary tones were more likely to occur under focus than monotonal tones. In addition, in focused constituents, durational expansion particularly at the phrase-edges, expansion in F-0 span, and raising of the phrase-initial pitch were observed. On the other hand, defocused constituents were not phonetically reduced compared to the neutral counterparts. The results imply that the phonetic cues spreading over the focused constituent complement the exaggerated prosodic boundaries.","[Jeon, Hae-Sung] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Language & Global Studies, Preston, Lancs, England; [Nolan, Francis] Univ Cambridge, Dept Theoret & Appl Linguist, Cambridge, England",University of Central Lancashire; University of Cambridge,"Jeon, HS (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Language & Global Studies, Preston, Lancs, England.",HJeon1@uclan.ac.uk,,,Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2012-R56],Academy of Korean Studies,"We would like to thank Taehong Cho and members of the Phonetics and Psycholinguistics Laboratory at the Hanyang University, Seoul, for their help in the data collection process.

Unlike evidential sentences in languages that have previously been formally analyzed , e.g. Cuzco Quechua and Cheyenne, Korean evidential sentences with -te are compatible with both direct and indirect evidence types. In this paper, I analyze -te as an evidential that lexically encodes the meaning of a 'sensory observation'. I account for the availability of both direct and indirect evidential readings in terms of the variable temporal relation between relevant eventualities. I show that this temporal relation is compositionally determined by the interaction between -te and tense, and that it in turn constrains possible (direct vs. indirect) evidence types. I also provide empirical evidence for the modal meaning contributions of -te sentences, and develop a formal analysis in terms of Kratzer's modal theory. The paper concludes by discussing the empirical and theoretical improvements of the proposed analysis over earlier analyses by Chung, and the implications for crosslinguistic studies of evidentials.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Linguist, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Linguist, 1168 Van Hise Hall,1220 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jungmeelee@gmail.com,,,,,,,82,14,14,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-854X,1572-865X,,NAT LANG SEMANT,Nat.

This study examines this hypothesis by comparing disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in Korean women with differing levels of exposure to Western culture. Method: Second-generation Korean-Americans (n = 167) and Korean immigrants (n = 37) completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), and data from native Koreans (n = 937) were obtained from a previous epidemiological study, using a Korean-translated version of the EAT-26 (KEAT-26). Korean-American and immigrant women completed the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA). Results: Korean-American women scored significantly lower on the EAT-26 than Korean immigrants and native Koreans, who did not differ from each other. Korean-Americans were more Western-oriented than Korean immigrants, and acculturation levels were not correlated with EAT-26 scores in either group. Conclusion: This study supports the importance of native cultural factors in the development of eating disorders in non-Western contexts.

Department of Preventive Medicine and Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Korea Objectives: This study aimed to investigate changes in the smoking rate among Korean adults from 1998-2009 by gender and occupational groups. Methods: Using the data from the first (1998), second (2001), third (2005) and fourth (2009) waves of the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), we examined men and women between 25-64 years old. Occupational groups were classified into 3 groups of non-manual workers, 5 groups of manual workers and other workers groups. The other group included the unemployed, students and housewives. Age-adjusted prevalence rates of cigarette smoking were calculated for 10-year age groups in each wave of the KNHANES. Trends in the smoking rate according to occupational groups were estimated. Results: Among male workers, decreasing trends in smoking rates were observed in non-manual workers, manual workers, and other workers. The odds ratios and prevalence ratios for the smoking rates of the manual workers comparing the non-manual workers increased from 1998 to 2005, whereas decreased to 1.38 and 1.12, respectively, in 2009. Differences in smoking rates between manual and non-manual workers increased from 1998 to 2005 but decreased from 2005 to 2009. Among female workers, the smoking rates decreased between 1998 and 2001 and increased beginning in 2001. Conclusions: The smoking rate of the manual workers group was still higher than that of the non-manual workers group. Anti-smoking programs specific to each occupational group are needed.

Working in partnership with the North Central Texas Area Agency on Aging (NCTAAA) and 2-1-1 services at United Way, the researcher asked 53 Korean pastors in two counties in North Central Texas to participate in the study. Each was asked about his willingness to host an outreach program. Thirty telephone surveys and 11 face-to-face interviews inquired about current services and pastor willingness to serve as gatekeepers for seniors. Translation and transportation were the top social service needs. All pastors in the study agreed that their churches should be a vehicle to provide social service information to seniors. Indeed, five churches accommodated program outreach offered by the NCTAAA and 2-1-1 services. The host churches tended to have highly structured, regularly scheduled programs (e.g., ethnic senior schools) already in place. A total of 405 Korean seniors participated in the outreach events, and 28 seniors were assisted in benefit counseling by telephone. Altogether, the results suggest that social service agencies can use the church ties of Korean seniors for program outreach.","[Kim, Eunkyung] Kwangwoon Univ, Grad Sch Counseling Welf & Policy, Seoul, South Korea",Kwangwoon University,"Kim, E (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Grad Sch Counseling Welf & Policy, Kwangwoon Ro 20, Seoul, South Korea.",sena80542000@yahoo.com,,"Kim, Eunkyung/0000-0003-0770-6316",,,,,38,3,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0148-8376,1540-7314,,J SOC SERV RES,J.

A total of 3,009 elderly persons aged 65 years and older living in the community were analyzed. Results showed there are significant predictors distinguishing both nonusers from users and nonusers from former users. However, no significant differences were found between former users and users. Overall, this study moderately supports the findings of previous studies and revealed contradictory results for gender, education, and location of residence variables. Older Koreans who are male, educated, socially active, and living in urban areas are more likely to attend senior centers. The Korean traditional family system and service delivery network are suggested as a partial cause of the contradictory results.

The analysis selects ten obstruents situated in four prosodic contexts: initial, final, and pre- and post-stress intervocalic positions. Analyses compare the mapping of the obstruents onto Korean categories in the two databases, finding a strong logistic relationship between them, which indicates a process of loanword adaptation as a regularization of the cross-language perception patterns. This conclusion is also supported by differences in the maps across the prosodic positions, wherein loanword differences are correlated with perceptual differences, and by the fact that loanword adaptations are more variable for consonants that do not have a very robust perceptual map. The data, however, also exhibit exceptional cases that apparently indicate effects of a historical lexicalization of individual forms, as well as of an explicit sociocultural standard. Thus, loanword adaptation in this case, though largely indicative of a perceptual base, is more than just synchronic perception.*","[de Jong, Kenneth] Indiana Univ, Dept Linguist, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Cho, Mi-hui] Kyonggi Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Suwon 443760, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Kyonggi University,"de Jong, K (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Linguist, 322 Mem Hall,2012 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kdejong@indiana.edu; mcho@kyonggi.ac.kr,,,,,,,57,16,25,2,13,LINGUISTIC SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1325 18TH ST NW, SUITE 211, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-6501 USA",0097-8507,1535-0665,,LANGUAGE,Language,JUN,2012,88,2,,,,,341,368,,10.1353/lan.2012.0035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/lan.2012.0035,,,28,Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Linguistics,955VU,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000305049800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, Korean universities are competing for foreign faculty in an era of global expansion in higher education, so the success of any effort to integrate foreign faculty into Korean universities must entail more than the mere introduction of content classes taught by invited foreign faculty. Korean universities cannot afford to leave the recruitment and integration processes of foreign faculty or the potential gains to students, native professors, and the inviting institution to chance. We therefore outline a three-pronged framework that simultaneously focuses on student, faculty, and administrative considerations with the goal of not only increasing the effectiveness of foreign faculty recruitment and retention, but also the overall productivity of all participants in the process.","[Gress, Douglas R.] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog Educ, Seoul 151748, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Gress, DR (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog Educ, 599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151748, South Korea.",douglas@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,64,19,22,0,14,KOREAN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL INST,CHUNGCHEONGBUK-DO,"7, GYOHAK-RO, DEOKSAN-MYEON, JINCHEON-GUN, CHUNGCHEONGBUK-DO, 27873, SOUTH KOREA",1739-4341,,,KEDI J EDUC POLICY,KEDI J.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that included 1264 women (70-84 years) from the Korean and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS) who had records of their ages at menarche and their ages at menopause and had experienced a natural menopause. We used Fried criteria to assess physical frailty status. The ages at menopause and menarche were collected using self-reported questionnaires. Results: The prevalence of physical frailty decreased by 5.3 % with each year of increase in age at menopause after adjusting for age, marital status, years of education, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, polypharmacy, hospitalizations, falls, and hormone replacement therapy (p = 0.005). The prevalence of frailty significantly decreased by 4.1 % when the reproductive span increased by a year (p = 0.019). Conclusions: This study found that a later menopausal age was associated with a lower risk of frailty using Fried criteria. In addition, it showed that a longer reproductive span was associated with a lower prevalence of frailty.","[Lee, Y.; Kim, S.; Kim, B.

Methods: This study utilized data acquired during the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2008-2011. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body compositional data was obtained from a subsample of 6538 subjects (men 2804, women 3734) aged 18-39 and 4413 subjects (men 1872, women 2541) aged 65 years and older. The three definitions of low appendicular skeletal muscle and the EQ-5D-3 L-Korean descriptive system were applied to Korean older people. Results: For the ASMI cutoff points used, in men, the three cutoff points were ASMI 2SD (6.09 kg/m(2)), ASMI 20 (6.48 kg/m(2)), and ASMI 1SD (6.95 kg/m(2)). In women, ASMI 2SD (4.38 kg/m(2)) was the lowest, followed by ASMI 1SD (4.96 kg/m(2)) and ASMI 20 (5.33 kg/m(2)). Proportions of older subjects with a low ASMI using the three cutoff points were 9.7% (ASMI 2SD) and 40.9% (ASMI 1SD) in men, and 0.7% (ASMI 2SD) and 7.4% (ASMI 1SD) in women. By multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, men with a low ASMI had significantly high odd ratios for the three domains of mobility (p < 0.001), self-care (p = 0.005), and usual activities (p = 0.004) among the five domains of the EQ-5D and EQ-5D index (p = 0.010). Conclusions: The ASMI 2SD cut-off points for older Koreans, 6.09 kg/m(2) for men and 4.38 kg/m(2) for women, resulted in low prevalences of a low ASM, that is, 9.7% for men and 0.7% for women, and showed low clinical usefulness due to very low determined prevalence in women. Hence, we suggest that the cut-off point of the lowest 20% of Korean older people (men: 6.48 kg/m(2), women; 5.33 kg/m(2)) be used for older Koreans.","[Kim, Yeon-Pyo; Joh, Ju-Youn; Kim, Sun; Hwang, Hwan-Sik] Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Dept Family Med, Chungnam 519809, South Korea; [Kim, Yeon-Pyo] Chonnam Natl Univ, Ctr Aging & Geriatr, Kwangju, South Korea; [Shin, Il-Seon] Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Chungnam 519809, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Chonnam National University; Chonnam National University,"Shin, IS (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 322 Seoyang Ro, Chungnam 519809, South Korea.",isshin@chonnam.ac.kr,"shin, i/JCE-1227-2023",,,,,,31,18,19,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2318,,BMC GERIATR,BMC Geriatr.,DEC 23,2014,14,,,,,,,,144,10.1186/1471-2318-14-144,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2318-14-144,,,12,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,AX9TY,25535336,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000347246000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analyses were based on the panel data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing and included older adults from 2008 to 2012 (N=24,074) for the final analysis. Social exclusion was categorized into four different sub-dimensions: financial, social relational, social cultural, and emotional. The analysis was based on a semi-parametric group-based approach followed by multinomial logistic regression. The results showed considerable variations and different developmental trajectories by the social exclusion sub-dimensions among older Koreans; in particular, the results showed that being older, male, and less educated were significant indicators of social exclusion. This study adds to the limited body of literature on longitudinal studies of social exclusion among older Koreans, and the results will help develop interventions for older Koreans who are socially isolated.","[Chung, Soondool] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Social Welf, Ewha Posco Bldg 424,52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Jeon, Haesang] Korean Womens Dev Inst, Res Ctr Gender Based Violence & Safety, 225 Jinheung Ro, Seoul 03367, South Korea; [Song, Ahyoung] Gachon Univ, Dept Social Welf, Seongsnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Ju-Hyun] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, 99 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34134, South Korea",Ewha Womans University; Gachon University; Chungnam National University,"Jeon, H (corresponding author), Korean Womens Dev Inst, Res Ctr Gender Based Violence & Safety, 225 Jinheung Ro, Seoul 03367, South Korea.",gogero@gmail.com,"; Song, Ahyoung/KHX-6360-2024","Song, Ahyoung/0000-0001-6654-0235;",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016-S1A3A2924582],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea #NRF-2016-S1A3A2924582.,,51,15,17,3,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

We examined the magnitude of cigarette smoking effects on major smoking-related diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), among South Korean adults using nationwide and representative survey data. METHODS We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was conducted over a 9-year period from 2007 to 2015 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between smoking status and all outcomes of interest. A total of 24072 participants >= 40 years of age were sampled in the current study. RESULTS The study results were as follows: 1) Current and former smoking is associated with lower socioeconomic status; 2) The prevalence of major smoking-related diseases was significantly higher in former and current smokers compared to non-smokers; 3) The odd ratios of developing COPD were 3.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.44-5.00], 2.41 (95% CI: 1.68-3.45) and 3.45 (95% CI: 2.20-5.40) among male current smokers, male ex-smokers and female current smokers, respectively. The odd ratio of developing CVD was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.05-3.86) in male ex-smokers. Otherwise, no significant associations between smoking and other diseases were observed after controlling the sociodemographic and clinical factors; and 4) The risk for COPD tends to be related to the smoking amount and weaning after quitting smoking. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that COPD had the strongest association with current and former smoking in both male and female smokers after controlling for all potential confounding factors among major smoking-related diseases.","[Kim, Youngmee] Chung Ang Univ, Red Cross Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Won-Kyung] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Int Hlth Care Ctr,Dept Pulmonol & Crit Care Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea",Chung Ang University; University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center,"Cho, WK (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Int Hlth Care Ctr,Dept Pulmonol & Crit Care Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",wonkyungcho@hotmail.com,,"Kim, Youngmee/0000-0002-0206-7300; Cho, Won-Kyung/0000-0003-1540-545X",,,,,26,6,7,0,2,EUROPEAN PUBLISHING,HERAKLION,"SCIENCE & TECHNOLGY PARK CRETE, (STEP-C), N PLASTIRA 100, VASSILIKA VOUTWN, HERAKLION, CRETE 00000, GREECE",1617-9625,,,TOB INDUC DIS,Tob.

Twenty Korean Americans (7 adults aged >= 50 years, 6 teenagers aged 13 to 19 years, 7 children aged 9 to 12 years) were recruited from the Korean communities in Seattle, Washington. Each subject was given a camera and asked to take 24 pictures of objects, scenes, and environments that represented their perceptions of cardiovascular health and related risk factors. Subjects were asked to pick 2 photos and present their thoughts about them in a tape-recorded group meeting. Key concepts were identified from the discussions. Themes identified promoting cardiovascular health included good diet, exercise, a clean environment, and spirituality. The themes identified as the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases included bad diet, smoking, pollution, and stress. Expression of the risk factors differed by the age group. The shared cultural background also influenced the perception of the risk factors.

This cycle has been shaped by the diversified strategic objectives of NEA countries, the instability of the Republic of Korea (ROK) political structure, the fluid nature of the power structure of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the impulse of related countries to influence the regional situation. The key to reverse and to reorient this cycle toward a more amicable direction lies in the proper handling of big power relations, the improving of regional political cycles, the upgrading of the diplomatic strategies of related countries, and understanding the DPRK more precisely. As one of the most important issues confronting ROK diplomacy, the conflict-reconciliation cycle offers a reference for solving other regional and international problems, such as the rivalry between China and the United States against the backdrop of China's rise, the proper role of ROK diplomacy, the mutual understanding between the two Koreas, and the DPRK's efforts to ease its political dilemma through economic means.","Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zheng, JY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhengjiyong@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,1,2,0,6,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Methods: Forty-eight ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients were assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Score (PPS) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) at admission and discharge. Genetic analysis included selected SNPs (APOE, CRP, PTGS2, IGF1, etc.). Biochemical markers (vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine, cholesterol, and vitamin D) were measured. Patients with PPS < 5 received robotic rehabilitation. Results: No significant link was found between genetic markers and recovery. However, faster recovery was associated with higher vitamin B12, homocysteine, and cholesterol but lower folate levels. Higher initial FMA scores correlated with better outcomes after robotic rehabilitation. Conclusions: Metabolic markers may have a stronger influence on post-stroke recovery than genetics. Robotic rehabilitation, especially in patients with higher initial FMA scores, may enhance hand function recovery. These findings emphasize the importance of metabolic and rehabilitation strategies in stroke recovery.","[Lee, Jaewoong; Lee, Seungok] Catholic Univ Korea, Incheon St Marys Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jaewon; Kim, Min Wook] Catholic Univ Korea, Incheon St Marys Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Rehabil Med, Seoul, South Korea",Catholic University of Korea; Catholic University of Korea,"Kim, MW; Lee, S (corresponding author), 6 Dongsu Ro, Incheon, South Korea.",msdykim@catholic.ac.kr; lsok@catholic.ac.kr,,,"Grant of Translational R&D Project through Institute for Bio-Medical convergence, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea","Grant of Translational R&D Project through Institute for Bio-Medical convergence, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea","This research was supported by a Grant of Translational R&D Project through Institute for Bio-Medical convergence, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea.",,11,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1053-8135,1878-6448,,NEUROREHABILITATION,Neurorehabilitation,JUN,2025,56,4,,,,,463,468,,10.1177/10538135251329217,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10538135251329217,,APR 2025,6,Clinical Neurology; Rehabilitation,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation,3YY6O,40539614,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001465196100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Serotonergic system-related genes may be good candidates in investigating the genetic basis of schizophrenia. We aimed to investigate the associations of HTR1A C-1019G, HTR2A-1438A/G, TPH1 218A/C, and TPH2-703G/T variants with schizophrenia. A total of 202 patients with schizophrenia and 165 normal controls were genotyped for HTR1A C-1019G, HTR2A-1438A/G, TPH1 218A/C, and TPH2-703G/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In order to assess the severity of a patient's psychiatric symptoms, the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS), and the Calgary depression scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) were administered. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between groups via chi(2) statistics. Associations between the genotypes of candidate SNPs with the severity of symptoms were examined with ANOVA by comparing the mean scores of BPRS, PANSS, and CDSS according to genotype. No significant differences in the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of four SNPs were found between patients with schizophrenia and normal controls. There was a trend towards association of HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism with negative symptom. Negative symptom score of PANSS was lower in the patients with CC genotype than in the G allele carriers. These results suggested that C allele might be associated with lesser negative symptom. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. In the future, we plan to study the associations between schizophrenia and other genetic polymorphisms.","[Kim, Yong-Ku; Yoon, Ho-Kyoung] Korea Univ, Anam Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul 136705, South Korea; [Kim, Yong-Ku] Korea Univ, Div Brain Korea Biomed Sci 21, Seoul 136705, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University,"Yoon, HK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Anam Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Anam Dong 5 Ga, Seoul 136705, South Korea.",because@naver.com,"Kim, Yong-Ku/AAF-1680-2020",,Korea University,Korea University,This study was supported by a Korea University Grant.,,55,18,19,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0001-8244,,,BEHAV GENET,Behav.

The film was first presented to the public at the March First Movement memorial event for the newly established state in the southern part of Korea, the Republic of Korea. (USAMGIK), the film was used as a nation-building publicity film providing a blueprint for the ideal Korean community: ethnic Koreans living in Hawai'i. Musical elements of the film were indicative of two prominent features for the Korean nation-state: transnational Korean community sharing the same culture and a pro-American society appreciating Western/American culture. The former was presented through ethnic Koreans' appreciation of Korea's traditional song and dance, while the latter was exemplified by their performance of hymns, operatic song, and hula. The musical elements in The Rose of Sharon were in line with music-related cultural policies of the nascent ROK government established under American hegemony.","[Choi, Heeyoung] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Hist, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Choi, H (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Hist, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",hychoi1115@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,2,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,,2023,63,3,,,,,91,116,,10.25024/kj.2023.63.3.91,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2023.63.3.91,,,26,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,X1UQ9,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001096374300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our aim was to investigate whether weekend oversleep is associated with ever having asthma among Korean adolescents. Methods: We analyzed web-based self-reported data from the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey in 25,927 physician-diagnosed adolescent asthma cases and 266,160 non-asthma cases. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess socioeconomic status, health behaviors, psychological factors and sleep patterns. Multiple logistic regression after adjusting for factors was used to determine the association between sleep and asthma. Results: The asthma group slept less (<= 5 hours: 23.9% vs. 22.8%) had a later weekend bedtime (>= 1:00 AM: 58.1% vs. 57.8%), and an earlier weekend wake time (<= 7:00 AM: 18.1% vs. 17.0%) compared to the non-asthma group. After multiple logistic regression, a sleep duration <= 5 hours (odds ratio (OR), 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.14) and weekend early bird (weekend wake time <= 7:00 AM: OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07) were significantly associated with an increased frequency of asthma. Long weekend catch-up sleep (weekend sleep duration minus weekday sleep duration >= 2 hours) was significantly associated with a decreased frequency of asthma (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99). Conclusion: Long weekend catch-up sleep, as an indicator of insufficient weekday sleep, is associated with a decreased frequency of asthma in Korean adolescents.","[Han, Chang Hoon] Natl Hlth Insurance Serv Ilsan Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulmonol, Goyang, South Korea; [Chung, Jae Ho] Catholic Kwandong Univ, Coll Med, Int St Marys Hosp, Dept Internal Med,Div Pulmonol, Incheon, South Korea",National Health Insurance Service; Catholic Kwandong University,"Chung, JH (corresponding author), Int St Marys Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulmonol, 22711 Simgokro 100Gil 25, Incheon, South Korea.",klaatu70@gmail.com,"Chung, Jae/W-3109-2017",,,,,,34,7,7,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0277-0903,1532-4303,,J ASTHMA,J.

Unlike many other languages, Korean does not have many morphological cues that could aid reference assignment for null pronominals. Indeed, work in theoretical linguistics has classified Korean as a discourse oriented language'', in which empty arguments can be identified through discourse topics, with less reliance on sentence-internal cues than is the case for sentence oriented'' languages such as English. The experiment used a person-mismatch paradigm to test whether, once assigned to a discourse topic, the reference of the null pronominal could be shifted to a new intra-sentential antecedent, on the basis of morpho-syntactic cues, as has been shown in work in English on overt pronouns. The findings show that the null pronominal was assigned to the discourse topic on-line during the reading of the sentence, but that the re-assignment to the intra-sentential antecedent did not take place, despite the morpho-syntactic cues. Instead, co-reference with the intra-sentential subject was attempted only when there was no antecedent in the context. We interpret these findings in terms of the relatively high priority that Korean places on discourse cues.","[Kwon, Nayoung] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Sturt, Patrick] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Nanyang Technological University; University of Edinburgh,"Kwon, N (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",nayoung@ntu.edu.sg,"Sturt, Patrick/E-8496-2010","Sturt, Patrick/0000-0002-2055-6933; Kwon, Nayoung/0000-0003-1217-2515",ESRC [ES/G007128/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G007128/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,26,27,0,6,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0169-0965,,,LANG COGNITIVE PROC,Lang.

J,"Kim, JB; Sells, P",,,,"Kim, Jong-Bok; Sells, Peter",,,Korean honorification: a kind of expressive meaning,JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,honorification; Korean; expressive meaning,JAPANESE MORPHOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; AGREEMENT,"Honorification in Korean recognizes the elevated social status of a participant in a clause with respect to the subject and/or the hearer. Honorific marking may be manifest as a nominal suffix, a special honorific form of a noun, an honorific case particle, an honorific marker on a verb, or a special honorific form of a verb. Previous accounts have typically proposed a honorification feature specified as [HON +], with unmarked forms being [HON -]. The key idea in this paper is that these approaches are misguided and that honorification is a privative feature, syntactically and semantically. On the syntactic side, we argue that the frequently adopted position that honorific marking in Korean is a kind of subject-verb agreement is deeply misguided. Few previous accounts succeed with regard to the full range of facts, which are of three types. First, multiple expressions of honorific marking within the same clause progressively elevate the social status of the referent: the effect is cumulative, which [HON] cannot describe. Second, under previous analyses, some nouns have to be given a spurious and ultimately inconsistent ambiguity with respect to their honorific properties. Third, the different expressions of honorification do not mean exactly the same thing, which makes an account of multiple honorification within a clause in terms of agreement implausible. On the semantic side, we, building on ideas in Potts (The logic of conventional implicatures. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005) and Potts and Kawahara (Proceedings of semantics and linguistic theory. CLC Publications, Ithaca, NY, pp. 235-254, 2004), propose that honorific forms introduce a dimension of meaning in the realm of expressive meaning. As a kind of expressive meaning, honorification is simply absent from all forms which are not positively marked for expressing it.","[Kim, Jong-Bok] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch English, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Sells, Peter] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",Kyung Hee University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kim, JB (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Sch English, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jongbok@khu.ac.kr; ps58@soas.ac.uk,"; Kim, Jong-Bok/AAK-7146-2020","Kim, Jong-Bok/0000-0003-3286-0446; Sells, Peter/0000-0003-4284-6947",,,,,47,48,62,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-8558,1572-8560,,J EAST ASIAN LINGUIS,J.

However, there is a lack of research on risk factors for Korean women related to prenatal depression and the relationship between prenatal depression during the three trimesters and postpartum depression. Therefore, aims of this study were (1) to identify the prevalence of depression during all three trimesters and the postpartum period, (2) to evaluate the relationship between prenatal depression in each trimester and postpartum depression, and (3) to identify the relationship and differences in prenatal depression based on sociodemographic factors in Korean women. Methods: One hundred and fifty three Korean women were recruited from three maternity clinics in Korea. Prenatal and postpartum depressions were evaluated in the first, second (24-26 weeks), third (32-34 weeks) trimester and 4 weeks postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-Korean. Results: The prevalence of depression in the prenatal and postpartum period ranged from 40.5% to 61.4%. Depression in the second and the third trimester was significantly correlated with depression in the postpartum period. Unemployment and household income were risk factors for prenatal depression in the first and second trimesters. Conclusions: To assist women suffering from postpartum depression and prevent its effects, women should be screened for prenatal depression during all three trimesters. For Korean women with high risk factors for prenatal depression, we suggest that the Korean government establish healthcare policies related to depression screening as routine prenatal care and mental health referral systems.

The study finds that class, gender, and ethnicity variables are commonly found among Hallyu consumers in Taiwan, China, and Japan, although the ethnicity variable changes constantly according to the success or failure of Hallyu. Conceived as the working class female viewers who try to find the universal East Asian entertainment content that can satisfy the desire of both forward and retrospective learning, Hallyu fans have clearly manifested their agreement that Korean dramas, films, and popular music were acceptable as a midpoint between forward and retrospective learning. The capitalist logic of producing and disseminating Hallyu is to cash in on this demand from East Asian women. This paper argues that the success of Hallyu depends on the continuity of the new role of East Asian women as transnational consumers and learners of popular culture for inter-ethnic cultural understanding. The role of middle-aged Japanese women as leading transnational consumers of Hallyu through retrospective learning is critical in this process, although incorporating the East Asian male population into the Hallyu campaign is also imperative for its future viability.",,,,oingyu@gmail.com,"Oh, Ingyu/AAM-7089-2020","Oh, Ingyu/0000-0002-1645-8767",,,,,68,42,45,0,53,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2009,40,3,,,,,425,459,,,,,,35,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,497RZ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000270080300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the leaders in South Korea have sometimes made an effort to help these interests converge (and sometimes not), this has had repercussions as their military forces continue to make an effort to work together in an alliance where the infrastructure and interoperability of forces will change drastically in 2012 and beyond. Much of the problem has been exacerbated because of a radically different view regarding the threat from North Korea and the policy that must be taken to deal with its often rogue-state behavior. An analysis of potential new governments for both nations reveals a potential for continued disagreement and difficulties in both the policy regarding North Korea and the changing structure of the ROK-U.S. military alliance. The electorates in the United States and South Korea have already begun the process of picking their next presidential candidates, and in both countries this has the potential for leadership that will want a substantially different role for the military and for military alliances that protect their national interests.","Marine Corps Command & Staff Coll, Quantico, VA USA",,"Bechtol, BE (corresponding author), Marine Corps Command & Staff Coll, Quantico, VA USA.",bruce.bechtol@usmc.mil,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,"INHA UNIV, CTR INT STUDIES",INCHEON,"NO 253 YONGHYUN-DONG, NAM-KU, INCHEON, 402-751, SOUTH KOREA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

This empirical study of Saeronam Church (SC) in Daejeon shows that the unexpected crisis forced its congregants to look back on their faithfulness in terms of self-reflection, and hence, made them more committed to their congregation socially and organizationally. The theologically and politically conservative megachurch congregants tend to regard the pandemic crisis as a God-planned ordeal which must be endured not only through self-reflection and repentance, but also through protection of their congregation from secular authorities. This attitude made it easier for conservative congregants to protest against governmental quarantine measures more explicitly and collectively. While some argue that the COVID-19 pandemic basically accelerated secularity by shrinking religious influence on society, this paper finds this aspect remarkably opposite in Korean conservative churches like SC, and emphasizes how a secular challenge, like the recent quarantine measures, can intensify megachurch Christianity. In this sense, it claims that the second-generation Korean megachurches like SC cannot be explained entirely by traditional theories of urbanization, marketing strategies, and church growth.","[Yoo, Kwang Suk] Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Relig & Civ Culture, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, KS (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Relig & Civ Culture, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",ksyooii@khu.ac.kr,,"Yoo, Kwang Suk/0000-0001-6427-9547",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088321]; John Templeton Foundation,National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); John Templeton Foundation,This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088321] and John Templeton Foundation (Megachurch in the Global South' Project).,,26,2,2,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,NOV,2022,13,11,,,,,,,1109,10.3390/rel13111109,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel13111109,,,10,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,6W2ZU,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000895601700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, the study compares the relative influences of three major segments of Korean popular culture (Korean celebrities, Korean television dramas, and Korean popular music) on an image of Korea. A survey of 2836 residents in four international cities (Hong Kong, Bangkok, Sydney, and Dubai) shows that likability of Korean celebrities had the most significant influence on a country image of Korea, followed by Korean television dramas, but likability of Korean popular music did not affect Korea's image. The findings show that a country image of Korea positively influenced preferences for Korean restaurants, and reveal regional differences in the effects of Korean popular culture on preferences for Korean restaurants among the four cities. This study is unique in both academia and industry for its investigation of the influence of Korean popular culture by classifying Korean popular culture into different major segments of Korean popular culture, Korean celebrities, Korean television dramas, and Korean popular music. This study is beneficial to restaurant operators and governments by providing the information for developing strategies for expanding ethnic restaurants into global markets and formulating governmental and industrial policies for globalization of ethnic food and restaurant industries.

Accordingly, the need for an accurate assessment of the size of the North Korean regular forces continues to grow in preparation for full-scale disarmament to include manpower reduction. However, researchers and institutions are coming up with different estimates in this respect. In 2016, the ROK Ministry of National Defense estimated the North Korean military to be 1.28 million strong. Also, Eberstadt and Banister believed the North Korean military end strength in the 1980s was 1.25 million, whereas Lee Suk in 2008 assessed the number to be in the range of 1.04 to 1.16 million. To estimate the end strength of the North Korean regular forces, this research used the ROK military's personnel data to build a model for estimating the size of the ROK military. The model multiplied the number of annual draftees by 21 months (1.7 years), after which those discharged early were excluded. The consequent estimate proved to be highly accurate, with its margin of error at +/- 2 percent. Based upon this basic model, this research multiplied the number of annual draftees in North Korea by the number of years in service (10 years), after which those promoted to officers and those discharged early were excluded. The resulting number was the estimated end strength of the North Korean military. This research assesses the size of the North Korean regular forces to be 1.05 million (or in the range of 0.99-1.11 million) servicemen in 2018. Therefore, previous assessments (Eberstadt and Banister, Lee Suk, ROK Ministry of National Defense) seem to have produced overestimates. In the future, the end strength of the North Korean regular forces is likely to decline to 0.87 million until 2031 due to the decreasing size of the North Korean population. The North Korean government is also likely to make efforts to maintain its military end strength by increasing draft rates or the number of women serving in the military. However, if North Korea pushes too long and too hard in its effort to maintain its military end strength, it may face significant socio-economic problems. Therefore, the two Koreas will both benefit by continuing the momentum for peace and reconciliation, as reducing the military end strength on both sides of the border will mitigate problems from shrinking draftee pools and reduce socio-economic pressures.","[Tak, Sung Han] Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea; [Tak, Sung Han] Korea Inst Def Anal, North Mil Res Div, Seoul, South Korea",,"Tak, SH (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea.;Tak, SH (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, North Mil Res Div, Seoul, South Korea.",shtak@kida.re.kr,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,7,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Such studies, performed in developed western societies, have come to various conclusions which may not be supported in an East Asian culture such as that found in Korea. Objectives This study aimed to determine the factors that predict institutionalization of patients in Korea diagnosed with dementia. Methods Seventy-nine cases (37 institutionalized, 42 community-dwelling) in the Kwangju area were evaluated for patient characteristics, severity of dementia symptoms, caregiver characteristics, burden and distress. Logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of actual institutionalization. Results Six predictors of institutionalization were identified. Of these, three were patient-related factors: higher score on the Clinical Dementia Rating, higher score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and shorter duration of dementia. The other three were caregiver-related factors: younger age, higher education (formal schooling), and higher cost of home care. Conclusions As seen in previous western studies, institutionalization of dementia sufferers was influenced by both patient and caregiver factors. But, the specific predictors and their relative influences might be explained best by the particular social, cultural and economic situation in Korea. This study was the first of its kind in Korea and, as such, could serve as a reference for future infra-cultural and cross-cultural comparisons.

The US has repeatedly called for improved relations between South Korea and Japan and underlined the importance of US-South Korea-Japan trilateral relations to address North Korean threats and regional security challenges. Would we, then, expect the US to play a role in helping to mediate South Korea-Japan problems? If so, under what conditions and to what extent would the US get involved in South Korea-Japan disputes? If not, what makes the US hesitate to do so? We argue that US involvement in South Korea-Japan bilateral relations depends on the degree to which the US perceives the tensions as costly and risky for US national security interests. With an issues-based analysis, a granular examination of South Korea-Japan trade disputes and the spat over the GSOMIA in 2019, and qualitative interviews with former US government and military officials, we find that the US is more likely to involve itself in South Korea-Japan relations and more likely to use its leverage as a major power with its allies when it perceives significant risks to its capabilities to address security challenges, primarily those posed by North Korea.","[Wiegand, Krista E.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Polit Sci, Knoxville, TN USA; [Lee, Sojeong] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Natl Secur & Foreign Affairs, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wiegand, Krista E.] Howard Baker Sch Publ Policy & Publ Affairs, Ctr Natl Secur & Foreign Affairs, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Ctr Natl Secur & Foreign Affairs, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",slee138@utk.edu,,"Lee, Sojeong/0000-0001-5895-6599",Korea Foundation,Korea Foundation,This research was supported by the Korea Foundation grant.,,39,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1598-2408,2234-6643,,J EAST ASIAN STUD,J.

The authors analyse the key elements of the views of the Far Eastern Federal District residents on the countries of East Asia China, Japan, North, and South Korea. Also, the authors focus on such basic elements of these notions as historical memory, people's economic and humanitarian needs, and external threats to regional and national security. It is established that historical memory works selectively. Regarding China, it supports the uncertain feelings of Pacific Russians in the finality of resolving the border issue between the two countries, while Japanese territorial claims are primarily perceived through the prism of modern politics. However, neither one nor the other prevents the inhabitants' interest in the history and culture of the neighboring states, focusing their economic interests on interaction, first of all, with these three countries. It is China, Japan, and South Korea that they consistently view as major economic partners of Pacific Russia. The authors estimate that the high level of development of these countries' economies along with the uniqueness and attractiveness of authentic cultures, as well as positive assessments of the current state and prospects of bilateral relations en masse have become the forces of attraction that encourage the Far Easterners to have a fellow feeling for them. At the same time, the countries of the Korean peninsula receive much less attention in Pacific Russia, and their images are mostly neutral and vague. The authors also note that the stereotypes that were rooted in the minds of Russians more than a century ago (the refined culture of Japan and the poor, uncultured China) place these two countries on different levels in the rating of their sympathies: Japan was a stable and undisputed leader, while China, despite noticeable rising popularity in recent years, along with South Korea remained in the middle. Finally, they conclude that a large proportion of the residents of the region, although not trusting their Asian neighbours too much, are not only interested in an economic interaction with the surrounding Asian world but are also psychologically committed to it.","[Larin, Viktor; Larina, Lilila] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Hist Archaeol & Ethnol Peoples Far East, Far Eastern Branch, Vladivostok, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences,"Larin, V (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Hist Archaeol & Ethnol Peoples Far East, Far Eastern Branch, Vladivostok, Russia.",,"Larin, Viktor/AAT-7416-2020",,,,,,24,1,1,0,2,URAL FEDERAL UNIV,EKATERINBURG,"PROSPEKT LENINA 51, EKATERINBURG, 620083, RUSSIA",2311-911X,2313-6871,,QUAESTIO ROSS,Quaestio Ross.,,2022,10,4,,,,,1241,1257,,10.15826/qr.2022.4.726,http://dx.doi.org/10.15826/qr.2022.4.726,,,17,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,9R3SW,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000945576000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are two possible scenarios for the nuclear future of North Korea, and in turn, the security of South Korea and Northeast Asia: containment, in which North Korea remains nuclear-armed with a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons and gradually improving delivery capabilities; and gradual rapprochement with the USA, South Korea, and Japan. In either of these cases a Northeast Asian NWFZ or a Japan-South Korea NWFZ would improve prospects for regional stability and a denuclearized Korean peninsula and could make a significant impact in light of North Korea's nuclear arming and other recent changes in the security environment in the region.

The Copenhagen School of security studies conceptualises an audience as possessing political agency which is contingent on their capabilities to respond to securitising moves. Drawing on Anthony Giddens's approach to ontological security, we argue that there is another type of agency supplementing political agency. Ontological agency refers to exercising control over the stability and continuity of one's everyday routines and practices to minimise disruption to these routines caused by securitisation. Because routines of day-to-day life are central to bracketing sources of anxiety, people may choose to overlook and not react to securitising moves designating threats and implementing emergency measures that can undermine ontological security. We illustrate the analytical purchase of ontological agency by using unstructured observations of South Korean people's responses to military practices that securitise North Korea. Our observations reveal that there is latent anxiety regarding North Korea that manifests in varying degrees ranging from inaction when routines are not disrupted by securitisation to outward bursts of emotional reactions and breakdown when securitisation practices disrupt people's basic routines. This raises implications about the importance of ontological security driving the success or failure of securitisation and the politics of existentialism.","[Ku, Minseon] William & Mary, Global Res Inst, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Finch, Brian] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Ku, M (corresponding author), William & Mary, Global Res Inst, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",mku@wm.edu,,"Finch, Brian/0009-0009-3758-6184",,,,,80,1,1,3,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0260-2105,1469-9044,,REV INT STUD,Rev.

To face the defeat of Ming Dynasty in the Battle of Saerhu, Xu Guangqi implored Emperor Wanli for the approval of the Korea superintendence strategy and volunteered to go to Korea with the mission. Outwardly, it was known as Korea superintendence strategy, but in fact it was Korea missionary attempt. Xu Guangqi's plan obtained Longobardo's approval and he decided to go to Korea with Sambiasi with newly printed missionary books.

Objective: This study aims to identify the optimal SBP level for minimizing all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)mortality in older Korean adults with hypertension. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service database. We included olderadults aged 65 years or older who were newly diagnosed with hypertension and underwent a National Health Insurance Servicehealth checkup in 2003-2004. We excluded patients who had a history of hypertension or CVD, were not prescribed medicationfor hypertension, had missing blood pressure or any other covariate values, and had fewer than 2 health checkups during thefollow-up period until 2020. We categorized the average SBP levels into 6 categories in 10 mm Hg increments, from <120 mmHg to >= 160 mm Hg; 130-139 mm Hg was the reference range. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine therelationship between SBP and all-cause and CVD mortalities, and subgroup analysis was conducted by age group (65-74 yearsand 75 years or older). Results: A total of 68,901 older adults newly diagnosed with hypertension were included in this study. During the follow-upperiod, 32,588 (47.3%) participants had all-cause mortality and 4273 (6.2%) had CVD mortality. Compared to older adults withSBP within the range of 130-139 mm Hg, individuals who fell into the other SBP categories, excluding those with SBP 120-129mm Hg, showed significantly higher all-cause and CVD mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that older adults aged 65-74 yearshad higher all-cause and CVD mortality rates according to SBP categories than those aged 75 years or older. Conclusions: The SBP levels within the range of 120-139 mm Hg were associated with the lowest all-cause and CVD mortalityrates among older Korean adults with hypertension. It is recommended to reduce SBP to <140 mm Hg, with 120 mm Hg as theminimum value for SBP, for older Korean adults with hypertension.

Although it could not be viewed as an imminent and irreversible decision, the softening of the Bush administration's position represents a major change in distrustful interactions between the two countries. What made the Bush administration change its policy course against North Korea, which had continued for a quite long time? Regarding the real effectiveness of sanctions against North Korea, this study seeks to focus on the changing perspectives on economic sanctions in US-DPRK relations and the changing strategy of the Bush administration toward North Korea. Eventually the Bush administration did not give up its basic attitudes on the economic sanctions against North Korea, but redesigned its existing unilateral economic sanctions to build multilateral governance over North Korea, which could invite the cooperation of neighboring countries, and secure the validity of North Korean policy more easily.","[Rhyu, Sang-young; Bae, Jong-Yun] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Rhyu, SY (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,14,"INHA UNIV, CTR INT STUDIES",INCHEON,"NO 253 YONGHYUN-DONG, NAM-KU, INCHEON, 402-751, SOUTH KOREA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

Previous researchers have reported that ethnicity could be one of factors associated with the development of COPD. This study aimed to examine the factors associated with the development of airflow limitation, suggestive of having COPD, among Korean smokers using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted over the past 3 years. METHODS A total of 2569 current and former smokers >= 40 years of age were included. Most studies exploring risk factors for COPD have compared smokers and non-smokers with smoking as only one of the independent variables. In this study, we took a different approach, studying only smokers and comparing those with or without airflow limitation. RESULTS The prevalence of airflow limitation among the study participants was 19.2% and 22.1% in current and former smokers, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the severity of airflow limitation and total lifetime smoking amount. Among the many variables examined, only age, male gender and total lifetime smoking amount (pack-years) were significant factors associated with the development of cigarette smoke-induced airflow limitation. CONSLUSIONS Older Korean men who are heavy smokers may be at a higher risk of developing COPD. Our findings support the importance of smoking cessation as the best way to prevent the development of COPD.","[Kim, Youngmee] Chung Ang Univ, Red Cross Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Won-Kyung] Univ Ulsan, Int Healthcare Ctr, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med,Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea",Chung Ang University; University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center,"Cho, WK (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Int Healthcare Ctr, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med,Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",wonkyungcho@hotmail.com,,"Cho, Won-Kyung/0000-0003-1540-545X; Kim, Youngmee/0000-0002-0206-7300",,,,,50,0,0,1,1,EUROPEAN PUBLISHING,HERAKLION,"SCIENCE & TECHNOLGY PARK CRETE, (STEP-C), N PLASTIRA 100, VASSILIKA VOUTWN, HERAKLION, CRETE 00000, GREECE",1617-9625,,,TOB INDUC DIS,Tob.

At the same time, it has been widely assumed that Korean has phonemically long vowels, allowed in the phrase-initial position. This article considers these two key issues of Korean word-level prosody anew. I claim that the long vowel in Chonnam and Traditional Seoul dialect is an acoustic manifestation of the metrical head, and show that an analysis based on accent rather than phonological vowel length yields a simpler account of the vowel shortening in verbal suffixation. I propose that in Chonnam and Traditional Seoul, there is a two-syllable left-edge window, where stress falls on the initial syllable if accented and, otherwise, on the second syllable. Acoustic analyses show that duration, pitch, and intensity all have significant effects in predicting the location of metrical head in Chonnam. In Traditional Seoul, however, only duration and second syllable pitch have such effects. I argue that the weaker relics of metrical prominence in Traditional Seoul reflect the historical shift of its prosodic system from lexical to phrasal. Implications of the metrical head on the Accentual Phrase theory of Korean (Jun 1993) are discussed with focus on the interpretation of pitch in Korean phonology.","SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; University at Buffalo, SUNY","Ko, ES (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",eonsukko@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,97,6,9,0,6,DE GRUYTER MOUTON,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, 10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0167-6318,1613-3676,,LINGUIST REV,Linguist.

The aim of the current study was to investigate how one variable, talker age, might interact with the perception of a theoretically independent variable, regional accent. We investigated this question specifically in the case of Korean: although many studies have reported on phonetic differences among Korean dialects and speakers' beliefs and attitudes about them, there has been virtually no research on the auditory perception of such variation. Potential acoustic cues to regional accent were measured in read sentence productions from a total of 72 male talkers in their 20s or 50s to 60s from six Korean provinces. Then, in a perception experiment, native listeners from Seoul (n = 21), Gyeongsang (n = 10), and Jeolla (n = 10) listened to the sentences and were asked to identify the talker's regional origin from among 6 provinces. Listeners' responses correlated with talker age: young talkers were disproportionately perceived as being from Seoul, and old talkers-even life-long Seoul residents-were disproportionately perceived as being from non-Seoul regions. A follow-up experiment with listeners from Seoul (n = 30) in which talker age was treated as a between-subjects factor showed an attenuated effect, suggesting that the effect of talker age on perceived regional origin may be partially driven by a contrast effect, such that the speech of older talkers is perceived as less standard-and thus coming from a non-Seoul region-when being directly compared with that of younger talkers.","[Shin, Woobong] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Korean Language & Literature, Jeju, South Korea; [Lee, Hyangwon; Shin, Jiyoung; Holliday, Jeffrey J.] Korea Univ, Dept Korean Language & Literature, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Jeju National University; Korea University,"Holliday, JJ (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Korean Language & Literature, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",holliday@korea.ac.kr,"Holliday, Jeffrey/JXM-0723-2024","Holliday, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9248-0165",SPO Research Grant [12168092300],SPO Research Grant,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by SPO Research Grant #12168092300 awarded to Jiyoung Shin.",,74,3,3,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0023-8309,1756-6053,,LANG SPEECH,Lang.

Korea is one of the fastest aging countries, and the prospective relationship of handgrip strength with all-cause mortality in Korean adults has not been studied. We conducted a prospective observation study to examine whether baseline handgrip strength predicted mortality over eight years of follow-ups in Korean adults aged 45 years or older. We analyzed the nationwide survey data based on 9393 Korean adults (mean age of 61 +/- 10.7 years) from the 2006-2014 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging. The mean handgrip strength values measured using a dynamometer, and were divided into quartiles for each gender. Cox models were conducted in order to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to handgrip strength adjusting for covariates. There was a robust independent relationship between a weaker handgrip strength and higher all-cause mortality in both women and men, adjusting for selected covariates (e.g., age, income, smoking, exercise, and comorbidities). Compared to the strongest quartile (i.e., reference), women and men in the weakest group had higher HRs of mortality, 2.5 (95% CI: 1.7-3.8) vs. 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.9), respectively. The robust independent relationships between weaker handgrip strength and higher all-cause mortality found in the study suggest that simply assessing and monitoring the handgrip strength during adulthood demonstrates great potentials for the public health of aging populations, and protects against premature death in Korean adults.","[Bae, Eun-Jung] Dongnam Inst Radiol & Med Sci, Div Nursing, Busan 46033, South Korea; [Bae, Eun-Jung; Kim, Yun-Hee] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Nursing, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Park, Na-Jin] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Nursing, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Sohn, Hae-Sook] Inje Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Busan 47392, South Korea",Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences; Pukyong National University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Inje University,"Kim, YH (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Nursing, Busan 48513, South Korea.",beaulife80@gmail.com; parknj@pitt.edu; pmshs@inje.ac.kr; soohappy0030@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,49,52,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

North Korea had already shown an interest in the establishment of a Nuclear-Weapon- Free Zone (NWFZ) in 1954; however, it began to assert the establishment of a NWFZ in the Korean Peninsula by applying the concept to their security environment in 1976, in which it started its activities as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. The implementation of North Korea's denuclearization policy on the Korean Peninsula unfolded in 1986, as North Korea authorized its plan for the denuclearization of the Peninsula as an immediate objective of its diplomatic activities. That is, North Korea pursued the establishment of a denuclearized zone on the Peninsula with the goal of managing its relationship with the Soviet Union and strengthening diplomacy of the Non-Aligned in 1986. Even though North Korea's traditional claim for denuclearization of the Peninsula no longer served as an immediate task after 1994, when the first North Korean nuclear crisis was resolved, it re-emerged at the policy-level due to the 9.19 Joint Statement in 2005. Such re-authorization as party discourses was influenced by the engagement of the United States and South Korea, and active persuasion by China. It is noted that the denuclearization policy for the Korean Peninsula was re-authorized as party discourses of North Korea even after their declaration of nuclear-state status. Though this assertion towards denuclearization of the Peninsula remained as party discourses even after the suspension of the Six-Party Talks, it is yet unclear whether their willingness to pursue this policy has once again been reinforced at the higher levels amid the recent situation of the inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea dialogues. It is inevitable that the diplomatic solution for the North Korean nuclear issue shall begin by reinforcing the denuclearization argument in North Korea. It is time to draw the international community's coordinated engagement to make North Korea choose denuclearization more clearly.","[Lee, Choongkoo] Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea",,"Lee, C (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea.",nile999@gmail.com,"; Lee, Choongkoo/AIA-4059-2022","Lee, Choongkoo/0000-0002-5628-8459;",,,,,52,1,1,0,9,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

The second section introduces complex systems theory as an analytical approach that injects more sophistication and dynamic into the otherwise overly structural analysis typical of the field. The third and fourth sections reconstruct the unfolding of major events in terms of a positive feedback loop - namely, how great power realpolitik and North Korea's provocations converged and ricocheted to cause the crisis in 2017, as well as a negative feedback loop in which triangular interactions both facilitated and obstructed US - North Korea wrangling.

This work critically examines the economic relationship between Ghana and South Korea in the last forty years. It focuses on the economic miracle of South Korea and the lessons for developing countries like Ghana. The article utilizes economic, historical and policy data drawn from primary and secondary sources in an attempt to examine the economic relations between the two countries thus far and prescribe ways in which Ghana can benefit far more than ever before from her economic co-operation with Korea. The paper argues that for Ghana to benefit from its economic relations with South Korea the ideational example of this East Asian state in constructing a developmental state (DS) is critical.

Since the 6PT process has been primarily a negotiating arena for North Korea and the United States, through the mediation of China, room for South Korea's effective participation has been structurally limited. Nevertheless, the Roh Moo Hyun government played a significant role in suggesting innovative ideas, often defying the American stance to break impasses, and facilitating the overall process of negotiation through proactive diplomacy.

The theoretical framework we adopt to explore this condition relies on two ideas: heritage as a building block of national identity and 'heritage diplomacy'. By analysing the interplay between the place of martial arts in constructing identities and their 'heritage as diplomacy' practice, we make three contributions: we offer a hitherto unexplored angle on Korean identity-formation processes and inter-Korean relations; we introduce a unique case study pertaining to the involvement of non-Western states in heritage diplomacy; and, we contribute to the scant literature on intangible heritage in heritage diplomacy. More than a sports-diplomacy tool, the case of martial arts reveals the seemingly paradoxical nature of inter-Korean cultural heritage politics: the struggle to reinforce separate Korean national identities by resorting to the same heritage concomitantly contributes, in several ways, to the idea and sense of Korean 'oneness'. The paper also maintains that such inter-Korean collaborations are advantageous in the growing competition among Asian nations for UNESCO's recognition of cultural heritage.","[Rozenfeld (Lachina), Eugenia] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept East Asian Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Podoler, Guy] Univ Haifa, Dept Asian Studies, Haifa, Israel",Tel Aviv University; University of Haifa,"Rozenfeld, E (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept East Asian Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel.",lachinha@tauex.tau.ac.il,,"Rozenfeld (Lachina), Eugenia/0000-0001-7007-9728",,,,,77,2,2,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

Gumgang tourism development in North Korea as a vehicle for promoting peace on the Korean peninsula. The study finds that residents' perceptions of international tourism development can influence national and international policy. Second, the study provides insights into the political impacts of tourism development being conducted in a country that is widely regarded as hostile by potential visitors, but which shares many ethnic and cultural links with its major origin market. Third, the study finds that there is a role for tourism in developing peaceful relations between hostile nations. An important consideration arising from this research is that the use of tourism for political purposes introduces non-market considerations that have the potential to become more important than pleasure motives in the weighting of consumer's decision sets on destination selection. An adaptation of a model for the study of international relations based on games theory is used to demonstrate these relationships. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Korean professional soccer started in 1983 under the name of the Super League, not by popular demand but by from political backgrounds. The sport was off to a bad start, and this became an inherent limitation and the reason Korean professional soccer did not flourish. In addition, although Korean professional soccer had grown rapidly in terms of quantity based on a consistent increase in professional teams and the introduction of advanced systems, the cultural limitations of an incomplete local franchise system and a lack of public attention were revealed. Korean professional soccer has shown a variety of sociocultural limits while rapidly developing in its short history.

Korean has the distinction of being a language that has a productive non-factive 'know' (found in Altaic languages), -uro al-, which does not embed a factive presupposition complement, that is nonetheless supported by limited evidential justification ('believe' is not). In terms of politeness, this is an excellent way to indicate disagreement with a social superior, as it works both the negative and positive face of the superior. Therefore, this research aims to understand how non-factive 'know' is interpreted as compared to other expressions in terms of politeness and appropriateness, in different power situations. It is clearly demonstrated that non-factive 'know' is considered to be the most polite way to indicate disagreement. Moreover, participants' politeness levels were measured psychometrically, revealing how their choices were influenced by their individual politeness characteristics. This factivity phenomenon is given a clear theoretical treatment in relation to politeness. In sum, researching the relationship between factivity and politeness opens new research avenues in languages which take advantage of the non-factive 'know' phenomenon. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Conservatives restrict pro-communist and pro-LGBT speech, while progressives target racist slurs and especially far-right speech supporting Japanese colonial (1910-1945) or anti-communist (1948-1987) regimes. These controversial restrictions contribute to a global debate among proponents of liberal-democratic values (liberals or democrats) about the relationship between procedural and substantive rights and norms (PRN, SRN). Procedural refers to formal-legal rights (e.g., free speech) and non-legal norms (impartial reporting) associated with fair procedures. Substantive refers to rights and norms associated with fair substantive outcomes, such as nondiscrimination and equal dignity. Proponents of a zero-sum perspective, including victim-rights and militant-democracy advocates, believe illiberal actors exploit PRN to harm vulnerable groups and/or democratic institutions. Therefore, liberal procedural rights (e.g., free speech) and norms (objectivity) should not be equally applied to harmful speakers. Conversely, positive-sum advocates argue that uniformly respecting procedural rights and norms for all persons (including allegedly illiberal ones) better protects everyone's overall rights (procedural and substantive). Despite South Korea's transition to civilian-led democracy, self-identified democrats, both conservative and progressive, continue to restrict PRN for certain speakers. Other democrats oppose such selective, and often arbitrary, restrictions. The ongoing contestation among zero- and positive-sum liberals shapes the meaning and direction of liberal democracy in South Korea.","[Yi, Joseph] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Gowoon] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University; Kyung Hee University,"Yi, J (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",joyichicago@yahoo.com,"Jung, Gowoon/AAI-8458-2020; Yi, Joseph E./ACS-5880-2022","Yi, Joseph E./0000-0002-3126-8515",Kyung Hee University [KHU-20220709],Kyung Hee University,"This work was supported by a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2022 (KHU-20220709).

Second, this paper defends sanctions, because they: 1) express the international community's moral rejection of North Korean totalitarianism; 2) constrict North Korean economic growth in the strategic interest of South Korea and its partner democracies; 3) deter other states from following North Korea's nuclear and missile path; 4) give teeth to United Nations Security Council resolutions; and 5) punish North Korea for international law (UNSCR) violations.","[Kelly, Robert E.] Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Kelly, RE (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea.",robertkelly260@hotmail.com,,,Fund for Humanities and Social Studies at Pusan National University,Fund for Humanities and Social Studies at Pusan National University,"I would like to thank John Mueller, Joshua Stanton, Mason Richey, and two anonymous Korea Observer reviewers for their many helpful comments.

Examining how the diverse and often contradictory messages of women's liberation and freedom have been produced, disseminated, and consumed, using the strong femininity implied by the notion of ssen-unni before and after Hallyu, we argue that the contemporary representations of femininity by women artists in the K-pop world reveal not only limitations, but also potentials in the changing cultural topography of Korean society.","[Lee, Jieun] Wake Forest Univ, Womens Gender & Sexual Studies, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Yi, Hyangsoon] Univ Georgia, Comparat Literature, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Wake Forest University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Womens Gender & Sexual Studies, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA.",leej@wfu.edu; hyangsyi@uga.edu,,,,,,,43,13,15,2,22,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2020,60,1,,,,,17,39,,10.25024/kj.2020.60.1.17,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2020.60.1.17,,,23,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,KZ3RX,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000523183200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Subjects and methods A nationwide study involving questionnaires was conducted on 5500 parents with at least one son attending elementary school. Responses were obtained from one of the parents. Results The response rate was 76.1% (4183): circumcision was most common in boys when aged 11 years, followed by neonatal circumcision. Of the parents, 91.3% believed that circumcision is necessary, while 2.1% believed it to be unnecessary. The principal reasons given for circumcision were 'to improve penile hygiene' (82.4%,), followed by 'to improve future sexual potency' (7.5%). Among those who did not believe circumcision to be necessary. the most common reason was the expectation of spontaneous retraction of the prepuce with age (55.1%). Most (88.4%) of the parents believed that smegma is not a clean material, and is infected by microorganisms. Most parents (80.6%) thought that circumcision would prevent genital tract infection of the future spouse. Peer pressure was one of the most influential factors in deciding upon circumcision; 41.9% of the parents were anxious that their child might be ridiculed by his peer group unless he was circumcised, while 27.4% of the parents believed that their child might be ridiculed if lie was circumcised. Mothers were more positive about circumcision than fathers (P < 0.05). Parents with a higher education and higher socio-economic status were also more positive about circumcision (P < 0.05). Mothers were prone to emphasize improved sexual potency (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in response between urban and rural areas. Conclusion This study indicates that common beliefs held by parents about the prepuce or circumcision differ significantly from current medical knowledge, and these beliefs have a major Influence on the practice of circumcision in Korea. More clinical research on the natural history of the foreskin is needed, and it is critical that both children and parents are informed about the potential benefits and disadvantages of circumcision.","Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Urol, Seoul, South Korea; Chang Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Keimyung Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Hallym Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Wonkwang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Asan Fdn Kangnung Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; Hanyang Univ, Seoul 133791, South Korea; Chungnam Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Pusan Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Chung Ang University; Keimyung University; Hallym University; Wonkwang University; Hanyang University; Chungnam National University; Pusan National University; Yonsei University; University of Ulsan,"Choi, H (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, 28 Yongon Dong, Seoul 110744, South Korea.",,"; Han, Seungwoo/R-5326-2019; Kim, SOOCHI/AAD-6959-2020; Oh, Seung-June/D-6015-2012; Kim, Kwang/J-5384-2012","Han, Sang Won/0000-0003-0941-1300; Oh, Seung-June/0000-0002-0322-3539;",,,,,9,22,23,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-4096,,,BJU INT,BJU Int.,MAR,2002,89,4,,,,,426,432,,10.1046/j.1464-4096.2001.01964.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1464-4096.2001.01964.x,,,7,Urology & Nephrology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urology & Nephrology,539BM,11872037,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000174850000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seoul did not demand costly signals from Beijing and Pyongyang to ascertain their cooperative intents. Moreover, Seoul showed eagerness to unilaterally send the rivals costly signals to convey its intention to cooperate. We aim to explain Seoul's engagement in unreciprocated costly signalling that diverges from mainstream theoretical expectations. We argue that the unreciprocated signalling stemmed from Seoul's belief that Beijing and Pyongyang might not know its own cooperative intent, whereas the latter two countries' cooperative intents were already sufficiently clear to Seoul. Therefore, Seoul reasoned that sending costly signals was crucial to convince Beijing and Pyongyang of its trustworthiness whereas such signals from the rivals were unnecessary. To support this argument, we draw on interviews with senior Republic of Korea officials, along with primary and secondary documents available in Korean and English.","[Paek, Sunwoo] Inst Natl Secur Strategy, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Sun] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, DS (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",ds0306@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Dong Sun/0000-0001-7064-3990; Paek, Sunwoo/0000-0002-1030-7239",Korea University [K2210121],Korea University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Korea University [grant number K2210121].",,79,0,0,2,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1369-1481,1467-856X,,BRIT J POLIT INT REL,Br.

J,"Kim, J",,,,"Kim, Jihye",,,Informal and Reliable: Bolivian Immigrants in Korean Sewing Workshops in the Argentine Garment Industry*,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Korean entrepreneurship; Korean sewing workshops; Bolivian immigrants; Argentine garment industry; employment relationship,BUSINESS,"At the beginning of Korean migration to Argentina in the 1960s and 1970s, most Korean immigrants in Argentina were intensively involved in garment sewing and knitting jobs, working as employees at or owners of Korean workshops subcontracted by Jewish manufacturers. However, due to the substantial upward mobility of the Korean business community, eventually Korean workshop owners, out of necessity, started recruiting workers from outside of their co-ethnic networks. Based on ethnographic research in Argentina, this study aims to explore why and how Korean employers have created labor relationships exclusively with Bolivian immigrants in their workshops in the Argentine garment industry with a particular focus on informality. For Korean workshop owners who are managing their businesses extremely informally, it is strategic to turn to the group they feel is most trustworthy. Bolivian seamstresses prefer to work for Korean workshop owners as Korean employers are deemed more dependable, pay on time and in full, and provide relatively better working conditions in comparison to Bolivian employers. This research further proves that it is particularly crucial for linkages of bounded solidarity and tacit trust to be established among all actors involved when employment and business practices are managed in a highly informal environment.","[Kim, Jihye] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Language & Global Studies, Korean Studies, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Language & Global Studies, Korean Studies, Preston, Lancs, England.",JKim22@uclan.ac.uk,,"Kim, Jihye/0000-0002-4254-7114",,,,,43,1,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

Data was collected throughout one year, and interviews with the mother, recordings of the family interactions, and ethnographic information were analyzed. The analysis focuses on the bilingual interactions between the mother and the child, how the collaborative process of constructing knowledge impacts family dynamics, and what resources family members draw upon. The findings reveal that the family members construct home as a space for collaborative learning by sharing their bilingual resources. In this process, maintaining Korean serves as a tool to access Korean resources for academic support. Discussion of bilingualism in the newly arrived immigrant family and how they negotiate and establish their FLP to maximize knowledge construction in the home as a bilingual and bicultural space will follow.","[Lee, Hakyoon] Georgia State Univ, World Languages & Cultures, 1838 25 Pk Pl, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Pang, Myoung Eun] Emory Univ, Dept Russian & East Asian Languages & Cultures, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Emory University,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, World Languages & Cultures, 1838 25 Pk Pl, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",hlee104@gsu.edu,,,Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2017-R22],Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies,This research was supported by the Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2017-R22).,,43,0,0,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-4632,1747-7557,,J MULTILING MULTICUL,J.

Drawing on critical analysis of conscription policy and media reports released between 2000 and 2022, the authors identify a mechanism that posits multicultural soldiers in one of two ways, either as incomplete Koreans who may lack patriotic spirit and may feel compelled to hide their family backgrounds or as extraordinary Koreans who possess a patriotic spirit and multicultural talents that will benefit the military. While this mechanism is shaped and practiced as a duality, the two seem ingly contrasting views are in fact based on a common premise that fundamentally associates the multicultural soldiers with a foreignness that others and excludes them from the family of pureblooded Koreans. Unpacking the military policies' convoluted effects, the article demonstrates how a normative authentic Koreanness is reimagined and reconstructed in ways that racialize multicultural soldiers.","[Chung, Ga Young] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Asian Amer Studies, Davis, CA USA; [Chung, Ga Young] Univ Calif Davis, Fac Cultural Studies, Davis, CA USA; [Chung, Ga Young] Univ Calif Davis, Human Rights Studies Programs, Davis, CA USA; [Chung, Ga Young] Univ Calif Davis, East Asian Studies Programs, Davis, CA USA; [Choi, Hee Jung] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Social Sci Res Inst, Jeonju, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Jeonbuk National University,"Choi, HJ (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Social Sci Res Inst, Jeonju, South Korea.",,,,Republic of Korea's Ministry of Education; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2021S1A5C2A02088731],"Republic of Korea's Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","First and fore most, we would like to ex press our appreciation to Minjeong Kim for her comments on the earlier version of the manuscript.

The number of Middle Eastern patients and families visiting Korea for medical tourism has risen rapidly in the past few years. Medical tourism from the Middle East is expected to grow, improving Korea's reputation in the region and generating financial gain.

Likewise, what they think is desirable or not for children is also reflected in children's literature translations. Yet adult assumptions, or ideology, may not always be in line with how children actually respond. This paper delves into this issue of ideology in terms of character name translation in Japanese picturebooks translated into Korean. While the majority of source text names are retained in English-to-Korean translations through transliteration, they are often changed into Korean names in Japanese-to-Korean translations. Interviews and an online questionnaire survey were conducted with Korean adult readers to find out how they respond to such differences, followed by an experiment with Korean children to see whether what adults think, revealed through the interviews and a survey, is consistent with how children actually respond. This paper hopes to shed light on how adult ideology affects children's book translation, and how this can sometimes be misleading to children.","[Sung, Seung-Eun] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Fac English Interpretat & Translat, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Sook-Jong] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Japanese Interpretat & Translat, 81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Kisun] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Oriental Languages, Dept Mongolian, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Park, SJ (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Japanese Interpretat & Translat, 81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",sookjongpark@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0324-4652,1588-2810,,NEOHELICON,Neohelicon,JUN,2016,43,1,,,,,213,231,,10.1007/s11059-015-0311-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11059-015-0311-z,,,19,Literature,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Literature,DS3SB,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000380701900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiences of the Korean film industry provide an important example in this regard. Over the course of Korea?s film industry, there have been three distinct periods of integration. This article analyses the causes, processes, and their effects. The first one was the result of strict regulations and strong government intervention. The latter two periods exhibit different characteristics: deregulation and pro-competition in a global setting. In fact, integration brought about rather positive effects to the industry when a business-friendly environment prevailed. Based on this study, the results show that integration can be used to enhance the competitiveness of a film industry. The analysis in this article can be useful toward providing a good reference point for establishing cultural policies for the film industry.","[Parc, Jimmyn] PSIA, Sci Po, Paris, France; [Parc, Jimmyn] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Commun Res, Seoul, South Korea",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Seoul National University (SNU),"Parc, J (corresponding author), PSIA, Sci Po, Paris, France.;Parc, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Commun Res, Seoul, South Korea.",jimmynparc@gmail.com,"Parc, Jimmyn/AAD-4706-2020","Parc, Jimmyn/0000-0002-4836-460X",Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2015-LAB-2250003],"Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2015-LAB-2250003).,,53,9,9,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-6791,1743-7938,,BUS HIST,Bus.

This research endeavours to understand what makes Korean Pop music popular to Filipinos, addressing two research gaps: the lack of empirical management discourse, and the lack of focus on the Philippine KPop market. This research employs a theoretical model derived from an academic and practical product development and consumer behaviour discourse. Data collected from 932 Filipino respondents was subjected to several statistical tests, including exploratory factor analysis (EFA), hierarchical regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results suggest that Filipino KPop fans are more concerned about the external environment that influences what is popular, rather than what looks and sounds good. Furthermore, KPop fan behaviour homogeneously cuts across age, gender, and backgrounds. This presents several useful theoretical and managerial implications enhancing the overall picture of KPop's international impact.","[Paolo Capistrano, Erik] Univ Philippines, Business Adm, Cesar EA Virata Sch Business, Diliman, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Capistrano, EP (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Business Adm, Cesar EA Virata Sch Business, Diliman, Philippines.",escapistrano@up.edu.ph,"; Capistrano, Erik/AAO-3633-2021","Capistrano, Erik Paolo/0000-0001-8122-5452;",,,,,34,5,5,6,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1568-4849,1568-5314,,ASIAN J SOC SCI,Asian J.

However, the high acculturation group has a more positive attitude toward, better understanding of, and more preference for Korean foods than the low acculturation group. Satisfaction, revisiting, and recommendation intentions for Korean restaurants are higher among the high acculturation group than the low. The low uncertainty avoidance group spends more money for dining out than the high uncertainty avoidance group, who perceive Korean foods as expensive.

The findings of this study are that the Chosun Marathon Bogeuphoe contributed greatly to bring forth Korea's golden age in marathon history and served as a diplomatic advance guard in enhancing Korea's national prestige abroad and opening up a way-out for the nation's independence. This gives a valuable lesson to recent sport administrators and sport associations occasionally blamed for their unsuitable management despite the affluence of human and material resources.

Previous studies have highlighted the economic benefits of ODA to both South Korea and Myanmar, but the political motivations of Seoul's ODA policy towards Naypyidaw have received less scholarly attention. To fill this literature gap, this article analyses the three political factors underlying South Korea's increased ODA to Myanmar over the past ten years: Seoul's considerations regarding North Korea; South Korea's geopolitical competition with China and Japan; and the domestic constituents of ODA policymaking in South Korea. Adopting the concepts of realism and soft power, this article argues that national security interests and political motivations, including the intentions of ODA policymakers led by the president, have been important drivers of South Korea's increased ODA to Myanmar. In examining the role of domestic policymaking dynamics, this article uses as a case-study the K-town project in Myanmar which figured in the 2016 Choi Soon-sil-Gate scandal.","[Kim, Hyo-Sook] Kansai Gaidai Univ, Coll Global Commun & Language, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan; [Kim, Hyo-Sook] 6-1 Gotenyamaminami Machi, Hirakata, Osaka 5731008, Japan",,"Kim, HS (corresponding author), Kansai Gaidai Univ, Coll Global Commun & Language, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.;Kim, HS (corresponding author), 6-1 Gotenyamaminami Machi, Hirakata, Osaka 5731008, Japan.",hskim@kansaigaidai.ac.jp,"Kim, Hyo-sook/JNS-7458-2023",,,,,,77,9,10,0,22,INST SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES-ISEAS,PASIR PANJANG,"30 HENG MUI KING TERACE, PASIR PANJANG, 119614, SINGAPORE",0129-797X,1793-284X,,CONTEMP SE ASIA,Contemp.

Two approaches to a Korean peninsula peace-regime-building process are required: inter-Korean and international approaches. The two Koreas should play leading roles at the inter-Korean and international levels in inter-Korean confidence-building measures by reducing tension through reconciliation and economic cooperation. A Korean peace forum involving the USA, China and the two Koreas under the 19 September joint agreement could conclude a Korean peninsula peace treaty to replace the armistice agreement and a peace regime could be institutionalized by implementing the inter-Korean basic agreement (1992) through inter-Korean cooperation. This article proposes a comprehensive, long-term roadmap for the Korean peninsula peace-regime-building process. The author makes three major arguments. First, the two Koreas and the four powers need to agree on a comprehensive roadmap for the Korean peninsula peace-regime-building process as suggested here. The inter-Korean and international approaches to the peace-regime-building process should be considered in parallel. Second, the North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully through the Six-Party Talks. Third, the two Koreas need to work together to find an alternative to their respective proposals. The author proposes a Korean peninsula peace treaty signed by the ROK, the DPRK, the USA and China as an alternative. Unless the two Koreas demonstrate their desire to cooperate through sincere deeds by implementing inter-Korean agreements and are willing to make concessions by working together for establishing a peace regime in Korea, there is little chance of achieving this goal.","Eastern Kentucky Univ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA",Eastern Kentucky University,"Kwak, TH (corresponding author), Eastern Kentucky Univ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA.",,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,4,"INHA UNIV, CTR INT STUDIES",INCHEON,"NO 253 YONGHYUN-DONG, NAM-KU, INCHEON, 402-751, SOUTH KOREA",1225-4657,,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

Human Rights and Selection Process in the Forced Migration of North Korean Defectors,KOREA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korean defectors; North Korean human rights; citizenship; refugee; migrant; conceptual dilemma,,"This study analyzes North Korean human rights for North Koreans abroad using three approaches-the concepts of nationality, refugee, and migrant. The first approach is that North Koreans abroad be given South Korean citizenship under the Korean Constitution. Yet, no country except South Korea recognizes North Korean defectors as South Koreans and this approach has contributed little to the protection of North Koreans from repatriation to North Korea. The second approach is that North Korean defectors as a group be granted refugee status. Each government, however, can determine a North Korean defector's refugee status according to its own assessment of the North Korean asylum-seeker. The third approach is that North Korean defectors be considered migrants. By viewing North Korean defectors as migrants, North Korean human rights issues may be reduced to universal human rights ones with which the government of an asylum country has to deal.

Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of heritage language learners display weakness in orthographic accuracy. Due to their previous extended exposure to oral discourse and limited experience in written language, heritage speakers tend to write the way they would speak, which results in frequent spelling errors. This study describes the construction and implementation of a dictation programme in a college Korean language classroom and discusses the use of dictation as a learning device to overcome orthographic errors. The online, computerised dictation programme and in-class dictation activities employed proved to be effective in sensitising heritage learners to written forms of the target language and helping them make connections between spoken sounds and written forms.

The operation of two relevancy rules-minimization and recognition in interaction-is examined together with how the absence or presence of grammar is complemented by multimodal resources of various sorts. For the analysis, three categories ( self-quotation, co-party quotation and third-party quotation) are posited depending on who the quoted character is in the talk. In quoting oneself or co-participants in the talk, syntactic resources, prosody, sequential organization and embodied participant frameworks collaborate in the interactional management of the quote without overt realization of grammatical resources traditionally proposed for building quotations in Korean. The multimodal character of quoted speech is most weakly realized when quoting a non-present ( third-party) character, not only because of the limitation in body and spatial resources available in the local context to recover various referential terms, but more importantly, because the interactional project that the parties are engaged in makes a distancing device such as the quotative particle - ko relevant. This study provides evidence for the intricate interaction between multimodal resources and grammar through investigation of an important realm of human interaction, that of reported speech.","[Park, Yujong] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Park, Y (corresponding author), 11811 Venice Blvd 301, Los Angeles, CA 90066 USA.",yujpark@gmail.com,"Park, Yujong/LRB-9604-2024",,,,,,32,25,30,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4456,1461-7080,,DISCOURSE STUD,Discourse Stud.,FEB,2009,11,1,,,,,79,104,,10.1177/1461445608098499,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461445608098499,,,26,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,407LB,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000263363500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is important to bring the extended stakeholders, particularly history scholars, into the authorship of textbook-making processes to reflect up-to-date findings for objective narratives in textbooks and to take serious account of issues that transcend borders, regions, and cultures from a global and comprehensive perspective.

Although this mass influx is generally understood to be a 'refugee' crisis, North Korean escapees have not officially been granted refugee status by China, nor are they recognized as such by the UNHCR. In response, academics have argued that North Korean escapees should be granted international refugee status under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. More specifically, academics have claimed that North Korean escapees should be granted refugee status because they meet the criteria outlined in Article 1A(2) of the Convention under the traditional, individualized interpretation of the 'refugee' definition. Mast the author is in frill agreement with the conclusion that North Korean escapees should be considered refugees under the Convention, this article reviews the problems with applying the individualized interpretation of the Convention definition to North Korean escapees, and instead offers an alternative method of establishing refugee status: North Korean escapees should be granted prima facie refugee status based on a group application of the Convention definition. This article is premised on the view that the manner in which countries address refugee flow is not only a matter of international concern and policy, but of international law. Consequently, the focus of this article will be the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol, given their primacy as the key legal instruments outlining the definition of a refugee and countries' obligations towards persons who meet that definition.",,,"Kim, MM (corresponding author), 50 Commons Dr, Toronto, ON M1T 1E4, Canada.",melissa.kim@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,13,YIJUN INST INT LAW,SEOUL,"562 GWANGNARURO, KWANGJIN-GU, NO 201 KYUNGWOO BD, SEOUL, 05033, SOUTH KOREA",1976-9229,,,J E ASIA INT LAW,J.

Additionally, many South Koreans are not well informed about the experiences of North Koreans. It is important to develop a university course that examines the experiences of North Korean people from a multicultural lens with an ultimate aim of promoting global citizenship. This paper provides a framework for the development of a university course that examines the experiences of North Koreans. The conceptual framework is rooted in the five dimensions of multiculturalism (Banks, 2012). Three course concepts are expanded on including: understanding the everyday lives of North Korean people, storytelling and discussion, and global citizenship education.","[Lee, Andrea Rakushin] Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jennifer] Santa Monica Coll, Santa Monica, CA USA",Konkuk University; Santa Monica College,"Lee, AR (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ Glocal Campus, Chungju Si, South Korea.",andrealee1216@yahoo.com,,,,,,,55,1,1,1,5,KOREAN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL INST,CHUNGCHEONGBUK-DO,"7, GYOHAK-RO, DEOKSAN-MYEON, JINCHEON-GUN, CHUNGCHEONGBUK-DO, 27873, SOUTH KOREA",1739-4341,,,KEDI J EDUC POLICY,KEDI J.

Korean celebrities have also been found to form positively perceived Korean beauty standards, consequently serving as an antecedent of Korean beauty product awareness and perceived beauty product quality among international audiences. Although previous studies have found that audience involvement with entertainment mediums has positively impacted product purchase and visitation, a comprehensive investigation of the audience involvement's multi-dimensionality has yet to be conducted, specifically, on the distinction between Korean entertainment (movies, TV dramas, TV shows, etc.) involvement and celebrity worship. The present study attempts to fill the research gap by comprehensively examining the role of audience involvement with Korean entertainment, celebrity worship, brand awareness, and perceived Korean beauty product quality on product purchase intentions as well as intentions to visit Korea. A total of 327 female Indonesian Korean entertainment audiences then validated the proposed conceptual framework. The structural equation modeling results found emotional involvement, referential reflection, and entertainment-driven celebrity worshipping tendencies to be significant antecedents of Korean beauty product purchase and Korea visit intentions.","[Halim, Thalia Metta] Sejong Univ, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Kiatkawsin, Kiattipoom] Sejong Univ, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Tourism Ind Data Analyt Lab TIDAL, Seoul 05006, South Korea",Sejong University; Sejong University,"Kiatkawsin, K (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Tourism Ind Data Analyt Lab TIDAL, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",thaliametta41@gmail.com; kiatkawsin@gmail.com,"; Kiatkawsin, Kiattipoom/L-1296-2016","Kiatkawsin, Kiattipoom/0000-0001-9536-3231;",,,,,78,18,18,7,61,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1405,10.3390/su13031405,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031405,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD7AH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000615665600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Korean minority education in Japan has taken up the challenge of reversing the stigma attached to former colonial subjects, employing a range of tangible props what Twine (1999) calls 'racial literacy' which prepares racial minority children to cope with and challenge racism at large. While embodying identity expression through Korean folk dance performances is an effective strategy, it faces constraints from larger social forces. Korean dance and music performances do little to challenge the dominance of mainstream values. These performances are embedded in everyday family, school, and community practices and paradoxically reproduce existing gender roles, broader pedagogical ideologies, and social structures. This ethnographic case study disentangles contradictions in minority education and shows commitment to alterity accompanies disavowal of alterity in relation to the hegemonic Japanese culture and society.","[Lim, Youngmi] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Lim, Youngmi] New York City Coll Technol CUNY, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Lim, YM (corresponding author), CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",,,,,,,,81,10,10,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0014-1844,1469-588X,,ETHNOS,Ethnos,MAR 15,2015,80,2,,,SI,,192,222,,10.1080/00141844.2013.831942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00141844.2013.831942,,,31,Anthropology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Anthropology,AW6XI,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000346408500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their production was compared with that of South Korean (SK) speakers. SK speakers and NK refugee speakers (N = 22 each) completed three tasks designed to elicit careful and conversational speech: reading aloud lists of one-syllable words and short phrases and participating in a sociolinguistic interview. The potential acoustic cues voice onset time (VOT), F0, and H1-H2 were measured and analyzed for 14,478 stops. Results indicated that in conversational speech (interview), SK speakers neutralized VOT between lenis and aspirated and used F0 robustly to differentiate the two categories, while distinguishing the long VOT for lenis and aspirated from the short VOT for fortis stops. In careful speech (reading one-syllable words), SK speakers differentiated all three categories by VOT. In contrast, NK speakers distinguished all three categories by VOT in all tasks, except for neutralizing the contrast for fortis and lenis in phrase reading. Furthermore, F0 was not used as robustly by NK as by SK speakers. We also examined the effects of age of arrival (AoA) and length of residence (LoR) on NK speakers' SDA. Our results indicated that the longer the NK refugees lived in SK, the more they could produce more SK-like stops. The results suggest that NK stop contrasts are likely distinguished by VOT, and these refugee speakers are in the process of acquiring SK stop patterns.","[Lee, Jungah; Idemaru, Kaori; Vaughn, Charlotte] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR USA; [Lee, Jungah] Chosun Univ, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 61452, South Korea; [Vaughn, Charlotte] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD USA",University of Oregon; Chosun University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 61452, South Korea.",jungahlee@chosun.ac.kr,"Vaughn, Charlotte/KLE-0145-2024; Lee, Jungah/NSU-4109-2025","Lee, Jungah/0000-0002-0265-5081",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea; University of Oregon,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); University of Oregon",This work was supported by funds provided by the University of Oregon.

In the second half of the twentieth century, South Korea's public health system faced a dual challenge: the colonial legacy of medical shortage and urban concentration, and the massive conscription of military doctors after the Korean War. The term 'doctorless village' was a signifier that reflected these historical contexts, symbolizing the chronic medical crisis in rural areas. Behind the crisis, there as a growing idea of reversing the constraints from conscription and using it as a solution for the doctorless village problem. Initially, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs planned two alternatives to fill the gaps in the public health network. One was to station military doctors in doctorless villages, and the other was to dispatch civilian doctors in doctorless villages and exempt them from military service. After a series of doctor mobilizations since the May 16 coup, the medical community generally agreed with this plan and publicized it. They developed arguments for alternative services through public health work and strengthened its logic. By the 1970s, the plan culminated in the establishment of the current Public Health Doctor system. In terms of condition and momentum, the introduction of alternative service in other sectors, as well as the extension of the consensus among the government and medical community, accelerated this trend. As a result, the doctorless village crisis in South Korea, which had been a critical issue for a quarter of a century, entered a phase of resolution by utilizing the conscription system as its institutional foundation. It represented an aspect of the 'Korean' public health system characterized by the entanglement with conscription.

TPE refers to tendency to perceive that media coverage influences others ( i.e., the third persons) to a greater extent than self( i.e., the first person). Three groups (non-Korean Americans, Korean Americans, and Koreans living in the United States) were compared with one another for their perceptions of media coverage. Specifically, this study investigated how much individuals perceived media to influence themselves versus the American public and the Korean American public. Additionally, the current study examined the extent to which individuals' focus on the shooter and their perceptions of media bias were related to TPE. The results showed support for TPE in terms of media coverage resulting in negative feelings toward Korean Americans and Koreans. As individuals focused more on the shooter and also perceived greater media bias against Korean Americans, they thought that the media coverage of the incident would be more likely to influence the American public to have negative feelings about Koreans and Korean Americans.

I argue that these staged dramas invite the audience into a heterotopia where the South-North border is symbolically blurred or spatially reinterpreted, as are the past and the present, and the social and the staged realities. In Sister Mokran, heterotopia is generated through the corporeal co-presence of two North Korean migrants on a thrust stage - a fictional character and a real person - and the complicated relationality between them. The spatial reinterpretation of the South-North border as a heterotopic zone in Those Who Cross The Line and border-crossing characters from both sides therein allow the audience to perceive a realised utopia on stage beyond the border in reality. In this article, in my critical and theoretical exploration of the two plays, I argue that the staged heterotopias are created through staged bodies, mise-en-sc & eacute;ne, and stage structure. In doing so, my research develops an in-depth understanding of the Korean theatrical public sphere, particularly regarding how contemporary South Korean theatre engages with the socio-politics of the border and those who cross it.","[Choi, Bomi] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Performing & Digital Arts, Dept Drama Theatre & Dance, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Choi, B (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Performing & Digital Arts, Dept Drama Theatre & Dance, London, England.",bomi.choi@rhul.ac.uk,,"Choi, Bomi/0009-0006-8811-4425",,,,,42,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-2761,2040-0616,,STUD THEATR PERFORM,Stud.

The relationship between the Protestant missions' emphasis on reading and Korea's Confucian culture of learning is of particular importance for an understanding of the growth of Christianity in Korea because Christianity's close association with literacy and sacred writings energised the Confucian imagination of Korean culture. Perceiving the reading of Christian literature, including the bible, as a salient way to salvation, Koreans turned to reading and memorising the scriptures to experience the manifestation of God's revelation. The high respect afforded to education and learning as a dominant cultural value constitutes an important, if overlooked, element in the replication of faith in Korean society that reproduced the gospel under their own familiar terms.","[Yu, K.

We observed a significantly higher behavioral frequency of comparison with Korean media figures than with Chinese media figures. Comparison with Korean media figures had the most extensive associations in our path model; the other two types of appearance comparisons showed limited associations.

China is the only country that has relatively effective channels of communication with both South and North Korea. However, in fact, these bilateral relations face challenges and China is distrusted by both. The distrust from the North mainly originates from the uncertainty about security protection. While the distrust from the South is mainly due to the China-North Korea military alliance. China is facing a dilemma on the Korean peninsula: no matter how it strengthens or weakens its alliance with the North, it will inevitably hurt one of its friends. No matter how good China's intentions are, its actions are questioned by the two Koreas. The way out of the dilemma is not to attempt to balance its respective bilateral relationships with the two Koreas, but to finish the Cold War and build a peace regime on the peninsula.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Int Strategy Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Dong, XR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Int Strategy Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiangrongdong@hotmail.com,,,,,,,24,4,4,2,8,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

As such, it focuses on the necessary military issues, some of the likely scenarios where these issues would arise (there are simply too many to address them all in this paper), and the likely political factors in South Korea, the United States, and the international community that would be at play during this time period. China is likely to be the elephant in the room, though diplomacy with Beijing will be key and the Chinese are unlikely to agree to anything unless it is very clear to the world that North Korea is obviously in the throes of collapse, civil war, or complete anarchy. Any contingency operation into North Korea will be a very large, very expensive operation. South Korea simply does not have all of the resources or the military capabilities to carry out such an operation on its own-but it should lead any effort to intervene in North Korea because ultimately this is a Korea issue. A variety of factors, particularly the instability of the government, are likely to ultimately bring about a catastrophe in the DPRK.

Even while retaining some sense of their ethnic and cultural distinctiveness, Korean Buddhists were able to exert wide-ranging influence both geographically and temporally across the East Asian region. This influence was made possible because Buddhist monks saw themselves not so much as Korean, Japanese, or Chinese Buddhists, but instead as joint collaborators in a religious tradition that transcended contemporary notions of nation and time. Korean Buddhists of the pre-modern age would have been more apt to think of themselves as members of an ordination line and monastic lineage, a school of thought, or a tradition of practice, than as Korean Buddhists. If they were to refer to themselves at all, it would be as disciples, teachers, propagators, doctrinal specialists, and meditators all terms suggested in the categorizations of monks found in the various Biographies of Eminent Monks. If we are to arrive at a more nuanced portrayal of Korean Buddhism, scholars must abandon simplistic nationalist shibboleths and open our scholarship to the expansive vision of their religion that the Buddhists themselves always retained.","[Buswell, Robert E., Jr.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Buswell, Robert E., Jr.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Buddhist Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Buswell, Robert E., Jr.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Korean Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Buswell, Robert E., Jr.] Dongguk Univ, Dongguk Inst Buddhist Studies Res Pulgyo Haksurwo, Seoul, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Dongguk University,"Buswell, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",buswell@humnet.ucla.edu,,,,,,,15,7,9,0,3,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

Contextualizing such practices within a longer history of cross-border reading in the North, the article highlights how North Korean poetry and drama from the immediate aftermath of South Korea's April Revolution of 1960 took up South Korean literature's image of the volcano and reimagined it as a symbol of North-South dialogue. The article then turns to Kim Myongsu's Mother of the South (1965), showing how the play rewrites the South Korean novelist An Tongnim's short story Hope (1963) in such a way as to engineer a convergence with a line of literary representations then being produced in the North about its own colonial-era revolutionary heritage. Finally, the article suggests that this convergence ended up reshaping such visions of North Korea's own revolutionary past and the figure of the militant mother that emerged within them.","[Kief, I.

During the economic recession after the Soviet bloc collapsed, the North Korean government was incapable of providing material rewards to workers. Thus, the state attempted to transform labor into a spiritual rather than material practice. Despite the shortage of material resources and energy, the regime had to make the workers stay in their workplaces to maintain social stability. At that time, North Korean fiction often described people who worked for spiritual enlightenment rather than for material gain. In the novel and historical prose of this period, protagonists work not for their livelihoods, but for their honorable death; they voluntarily martyred themselves for their country, party, and leader Kim Jong Il.

Specifically, there is a lack of studies about why the government of Seoul employed a conciliatory policy toward Beijing from the beginning of the 1970s, despite China's strong ties with North Korea that posed grave threats to Seoul. Although the power-based argument purports that the U.S.-Sino rapprochement exerted a considerable influence on South Korea's strategic calculation, it underestimates the fact that the South felt increased insecurity after the international detente. This article attempts to offer theoretical explanations for why South Korea initiated a flexible approach toward China in the 1970s and the early 1980s. First, by narrowing the scope of the alliance security dilemma to small powers, it sheds light on significant elements that have an influence on abandonment fears by small powers. Second, this article demonstrates how the theory explains the case of South Korea, relying on declassified documents and recent works. Finally, it discusses the relevance of theoretical elements to the present time.","Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA",Trinity University,"Joo, YH (corresponding author), Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",hyoo@trinity.edu,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,7,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

On the one hand, Seoul disagreed with Washington about the extended role of United States Forces Korea and the deployment of US missile defence systems in East Asia. On the other hand, these problems ironically coincided with South Korea's strong support for the USA in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. What explains the inconsistency of South Korea's alliance policies? Major schools of thought in international relations have offered explanations, but their analyses are deficient and indeterminate. This article looks at the South Korea-China-North Korea triangle as a new approach to explaining the puzzling behaviour of South Korea. The model shows that South Korea's alliance policies are driven by two causal variables. First, North Korea is an impelling force for South Korea to remain as a strong US alliance partner. This encourages Seoul to maintain cooperation with Washington in wide-ranging alliance tasks. Second, South Korea's policies are likely to reflect the way the nation perceives how useful China is in taming North Korea. The perceived usefulness of China causes Seoul to accommodate China and decrease cooperation with the USA. This might strain the relationship with the USA should South Korea evade alliance missions that might run contrary to China's security interests.","Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA",Trinity University,"Yoo, HJ (corresponding author), Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",hyonjooyoo@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,6,6,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7718,1465-332X,,AUST J INT AFF,Aust.

Success will require fundamental change to the North Korean regime and its behavior. However, North Korea faces a dangerous security environment with external and internal threats making regime survival its chief goal. Consequently, North Korea's strategic world view is firmly anchored in the international relations theory of realism. Increased pressure makes it more difficult for North Korea to move beyond the constraints of realism and the North's collapse would create even more serious problems for the region. This paper argues that a long-term, three-prong approach by South Korea, the United States and others in the region may be the best way to create the foundation for peace: diplomatic engagement that begins to reduce North Korea's security concerns; economic engagement to open up the North Korean economy to encourage forces within to push for change; and continued military preparedness as a hedge to ensure stability.",,,,tjroehrig@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,24,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SPR,2009,40,1,,,,,201,232,,,,,,32,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,423KZ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000264496500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The article then discusses Osgood's Graduated Reciprocation in Tension-reduction (GRIT) as the long-term strategy to dissipate military confrontation and distrust and to lay the foundation for peaceful coexistence and cooperation on the Korean peninsula. President Lee's current hard-line policy toward the North is too costly and dangerous. Militarization of the Republic of Korea's (ROK) North Korea policy may deter Pyongyang's further aggression; however, it may also lead to an accidental war that will inflict unacceptable damages and permanent scars on both Korean states. The ROK should begin GRIT toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a long-term policy by taking unilateral initiatives and inviting reciprocation from the North, while safeguarding its own security and key interests.","[Joo, Seung-Ho] Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Kim, Euikon] Inha Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Inchon, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; Inha University,"Joo, SH (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",joos@morris.umn.edu; kimek@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,43,1,1,1,18,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SUM,2011,42,2,,,,,255,280,,,,,,26,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,787YP,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000292412900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of this cooperation has been in the form of North Korean proliferation of weapons, training, assistance, and advisors. North Korea has assisted Syria in at least two forms of WMD-a chemical weapons program, and a plutonium nuclear weaponization program. While both of these programs have been largely destroyed, Syria will likely rebuild its chemical weapons program with North Korean assistance if not deterred by the international community. Conventional weapons are also an international security issue, as North Korea has proliferated a large number of weapons systems that have been used in the Syrian civil war by the Syrian army and Hezbollah fighters. North Korea has been a vital supporter of the Assad regime's military throughout the Syrian civil war.

The shifting fertility trends within both countries may have important implications upon their eventual reunification. Prior research has identified the demographic advantage of a relatively young population in relation to the actual German reunification in 1990. Conversely, demographers have identified a demographic disadvantage, in that the ratio of South to North Koreans is relatively low. This study reexamines whether changes in fertility levels in both Koreas have altered the demographic advantages and disadvantages highlighted in prior studies. The findings suggest that below replacement level fertility within the two Koreas as well as the relatively higher fertility in North Korea may not only erode the demographic benefit identified in the earlier study, but also exacerbate the demographic disadvantage. Thus, from a demographic standpoint, reunification at an earlier point in time may be more beneficial than at a later one.","[Kwon, Ronald; Admire, Amanda; Vito, Christopher] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Sociol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Kwon, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Sociol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rkwon002@ucr.edu; aadmi001@ucr.edu; cvito001@ucr.edu,,"Vito, Christopher/0000-0002-9626-6932",,,,,69,0,0,1,11,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2015,55,4,,,,,85,110,,,,,,26,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,CZ6IV,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000367205400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the U.S. has made strides to reassure South Korea by establishing the Nuclear Consultative Group in 2023, the South Korean public's heightened threat perception of North Korea has neither been assuaged nor translated into support for the U.S. extended deterrence. This situation contradicts existing literature, which posits that a state's restraint on nuclear armament can be attributed to the security guarantee provided by its nuclear ally. To resolve this puzzle, this study explores the nature of the South Korean public's threat perception and the factors determining its support for the U.S. extended deterrence. Empirical analyses demonstrate that South Korean public's threat perception of North Korea is substantially high in both progressive and conservative blocs.

Using social media data, I show that despite the polarized narratives at the elite level, attitudes of both conservative and progressive voters became unfavorable toward China following COVID-19's onset. Furthermore, statistical analyses of survey data show that this blame is strongly associated with negative perceptions of China. Although substantively not directly linked to foreign policy, blame of China is strongly associated with rejection of foreign policy alignment with China and a shift toward supporting alignment with the US.

Whilst the bidding for the Seoul Olympics was fairly straightforward, the tendering for the FIFA World Cup was much more competitive and ended with a compromise as the most convincing applicants were asked to co-host this mega event. PyeongChang's successful bid is partly the result of considerable stamina, as it was, in fact, the city's third consecutive attempt to secure this event. This paper offers a detailed account of PyeongChang's three consecutive bids, focusing on the underlying local, regional and national policies, the agendas and influence of different stakeholders and the lessons learned from previous bids. The paper will also explore the political significance and future challenges of this decision for the divided Korean peninsula.

The project was poorly conceived, vulnerable to corruption and ultimately ineffective. While Korea Aid marked a backward step for Korea's development cooperation, revealing many of the challenges associated with emerging donors, it also reflected Korea's aspiration to become a cultural and developmental alternative to hegemonic nations. This paper examines the historical circumstances that led to the formation of Korea Aid, and further argues that Korea Aid embodied a synthesis of 'cultural soft power' and 'developmental soft power' intended to create the perception of Korea as culturally and developmentally attractive and benign. Korea's current pursuit of developmental soft power intentionally transforms the country's development experience into a 'politically odourless' model, masking its authoritarian undercurrent and in turn camouflaging growing aspirations to expand its global influence.","[Kim, Suweon] Univ Western Cape, Polit Studies, Cape Town, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",kimsuweon@gmail.com,"Kim, Suweon/U-8993-2019",,,,,,87,15,16,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-6597,1360-2241,,THIRD WORLD Q,Third World Q.,NOV 2,2019,40,11,,,,,2052,2070,,10.1080/01436597.2019.1622410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2019.1622410,,JUN 2019,19,Development Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies,JH0IZ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000472248000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that Kim Dae-jung as a heresthetician disrupted South Korean politics based on stable regional cleavage by adding a new dimension of policy toward the North. Specifically, Kim Dae-jung's sunshine policy not only garnered electoral support in the 2000 general election but also posed a dilemma for his coalition partner, Kim Jong-pil. It was a dilemma in the sense that Kim Jong-pil had little choice but to defect or maintain the coalition; however, any choice would lead him and his party to eventual demise in a political game structured by Kim Dae-jung. Moreover, his heresthetics had lasting effects on Korean politics such as the creation of a larger coalition that supports cooperation with North Korea. This paper suggests the need for further research to rediscover Korean presidents' political strategies and their long-term effects from a variety of perspectives including Riker's heresthetics.","[Jung, Heon Joo] Yonsei Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Jung, HJ (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",heonjoojung@yonsei.ac.kr,"; Jung, Heon/KDO-9233-2024","Jung, Heon Joo/0000-0002-7188-6975;",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2011-413-B00003],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The author would like to thank Rogers Smith, Woolin Kang, and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Method Data from all reports concerning capecitabine (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code: L01BC06) generated between January 2011 and December 2014 were collected from the Korean Adverse Event Reporting System database (KAERS). Results: A total of 676 reports and 1069 capecitabine-related ADRs were identified. Ninety-nine cases (14.6%) were classified as serious adverse events. The most commonly reported capecitabine-related ADRs involved gastrointestinal system disorders (324, 30.3%), including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis, followed by skin and appendage reactions (220, 20.6%), which included symptoms such as skin discoloration/disorder/dryness, itching, and rash. Conclusions: Patients need to be educated about the common ADRs associated with capecitabine intake in a clinical setting. Patient characteristics must be considered when determining the capecitabine dosage and risk of ADRs, and nursing intervention is critical for preventing exacerbation of these ADRs.","[Park, Jeong Yun] Univ Ulsan, Dept Clin Nursing, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea",University of Ulsan,"Park, JY (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Dept Clin Nursing, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",pjyun@ulsan.ac.kr,,"Park, JeongYun/0000-0002-0210-8213",,,,,24,6,8,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-3889,1532-2122,,EUR J ONCOL NURS,Eur.

This plan consists of policies and programs aimed to quickly integrate foreign wives into Korean society. As a result, their legal treatment has been relatively favorable; however, some have claimed to be mistreated socially and culturally. While a variety of reasons behind such mistreatment might be highlighted, this study focuses on Korean identity and related nationalism. The study finds that Korean identity has been mainly ethnic, and as such, it is responsible for excluding foreign wives from the sense of belonging to the same nationhood. Furthermore, ethnic nationalism has affected the social context in Korea and the emergence of nouveau-riche nationalism from the 1990s onwards. Nouveau-riche nationalism has its roots in ethnic nationalism, and it asserts a belief in Korean cultural superiority over other nations, especially less developed ones. Therefore, nouveau-riche nationalism is responsible for evaluating others based on skin color and country of origin, signifying that fairer skin is associated with the Western and more developed world, while darker skin color is associated with poorer, less developed nations. As the majority of foreign wives in Korea come from less-developed Asian countries, and particularly South East Asia, they are often discriminated against because of their darker skin color and country of origin. The study found that this prevents their full integration into society and undermines the assimilation goals set by the Korean government. The study thus stresses the importance of education and raising awareness of human rights and equality to create a fairer, more inclusive multicultural society.","[Zmire, Zeljana] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Zmire, Z (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",zeljana@hanyang.ac.kr,"Zmire, Zeljana/GVS-8652-2022",,,,,,38,3,4,1,6,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,,2021,52,3,,,,,483,511,,10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.3.483,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2021.52.3.483,,,29,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,YK3AM,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000745090200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 13,618 participants aged 65 years and over were included in the final analysis. A complex sample logistic regression was performed to determine the impact of oral discomfort on HRQOL. The results revealed that toothache, masticatory discomfort, and pronunciation problems caused by oral health conditions were all risk factors for decreased HRQOL. In particular, masticatory discomfort (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.63, Model III (adjusted for all covariates)) and pronunciation problems (AOR 1.64, Model III) negatively impacted the HRQOL of the elderly to a great extent. Masticatory discomfort had a stronger negative impact on HRQOL in the domains of self-care (AOR 1.83) and usual activities (AOR 1.66), while pronunciation problems had a similar impact on all five domains of the EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D). These findings could serve as baseline data for setting up early intervention programs for the timely prevention of oral health-related discomfort problems that greatly affect the QOL of the elderly population, and for the development of comprehensive and efficient dental insurance policies.","[Do, Kyung-Yi] Hanseo Univ, Dept Dent Hyg, 46 Hanseo 1 Ro, Haemi Myun Seosan Si 31962, Chungcheognam D, South Korea; [Moon, Sook] Daejeon Hlth Inst Technol, Dept Dent Hyg, 21 Chungjeong Ro, Daejeon 34504, South Korea",Hanseo University,"Moon, S (corresponding author), Daejeon Hlth Inst Technol, Dept Dent Hyg, 21 Chungjeong Ro, Daejeon 34504, South Korea.",dk18684@naver.com; ssook-76@hanmail.net,,,,,,,29,9,10,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This article interprets moves within South Korea to support the UN COI's recommendations as taken in the interests of ontological security, or a stable sense of identity, which has also driven the state's broader initiatives on image management and nation branding. It extends the boundaries of nation-branding research by considering why and how a state may adopt policies that enhance its moral visibility and reputation in world affairs. It considers how a positive reputation is enhanced by demonstrating good international citizenship, promoting the visibility of state identity parameters beyond its culture and core industries. This article interprets the South Korean government's efforts to act on North Korean human rights following the UN COI, as well as the significance of being seen to be doing so at home and abroad as security-giving behaviour asserting its moral authority in relation to North Korea. It explores how a longstanding policy of relative silence on North Korea's human rights record acceded to identity-driven pressures arising from the UN COI and influencing South Korea's international image-management strategy between 2014 and 2017.","[Son, Sarah A.] Korea Univ, Human Rights Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Son, Sarah A.] TJWG, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Son, SA (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Human Rights Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.;Son, SA (corresponding author), TJWG, Seoul, South Korea.",sarah.a.son@gmail.com,,"Son, Sarah/0000-0002-3045-7939",Academy of Korean Studies,Academy of Korean Studies,This work was supported in part by the Academy of Korean Studies.,,57,7,7,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7823,1467-8403,,ASIAN STUD REV,Asian Stud.

In doing so, this paper reexamines the boundaries of Korean film history. At the center of this discourse are ten Joseon films the Korea Film Archive has rediscovered over the past decade, of which this article focuses on three Tuition (1940), Angels on the Streets (1941), and Seagull (1948); all discovered at overseas film archives. These three films constantly evoke and prompt questions on the conceptual definition of Korean film, even though they have been included in the historiography of early Korean cinema and been preserved materially in the Korean Film Archive. Tuition and Angels on the Streets, dating from the Japanese colonial period, and Seagull, dating from the post-liberation period. I examine their production and distribution on the boundaries between Joseon and Korean cinema and between colonial and nation-state cinema. Although the former two films aimed at becoming imperial Japan's state (Gukka) films, they came to be categorized as Joseon (Minjok, ethnic) cinema by imperial Japan since the colonial realities reflected in the film were problematic to mainland Japan. The nation-building propaganda film Seagull, which was produced and distributed in 1948, had to start negotiating with the state to become South Korean film. It could not be legitimated as a South Korean film as it was filmed, since the print was confiscated by the authorities due to the actors who defected to North Korea. Reviewing the designations of and the boundaries between Joseon and Korean cinema, this article takes a critical approach to Korean film historiography of the Japanese colonial and post-liberation periods in Korea.","[Chung, Chonghwa] Korean Film Arch, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Chonghwa] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Chonghwa] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Chung Ang University,"Chung, C (corresponding author), Korean Film Arch, Seoul, South Korea.;Chung, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.;Chung, C (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",flicks74@gmail.com,,,,,,,71,3,3,0,5,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2019,59,4,,,,,16,47,,10.25024/kj.2019.59.4.16,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2019.59.4.16,,,32,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,JY9XV,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000504759700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, the case of those Protestant churches that were imported from the North into the South in the suitcases of migrants around the period of the Korean War deserves special attention for several reasons. Firstly, networking among South Korean political actors originating from the northern part of the Korean peninsula was often done through these Christian churches, not only at the familial level but also at professional and political levels. Secondly, these migrants' particular ties with North Korea, which persist in spite of generational turnover, confers upon them a specific perception and idea about the North Korea from which they escaped. Between their will to protect themselves against the communist threat and their desire to help those North Koreans who were not as lucky as themselves, their vision regarding the North from the 1950s to the present has played a role in their actions as political actors in the South. Even though conservatism prevails, many of the activities undertaken in North Korea by South Koreans are done by Christian clergy.","Univ Paris 07, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Korean Studies Sect, Dept East Asian Languages & Civilizat UFR LCAO, F-75221 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Rivé-Lasan, MO (corresponding author), Univ Paris 07, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Korean Studies Sect, Dept East Asian Languages & Civilizat UFR LCAO, F-75221 Paris 05, France.",marie-orange.rive-lasan@univ-paris-diderot.fr,,,,,,,14,3,5,0,4,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

J,"Blank, S",,,,"Blank, Stephen",,,Outsourcing Korea,PACIFIC FOCUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korea; South Korea; United States; China; Russia; six-party agreement,,"The Six-party agreement on North Korea's nuclear program on September 19-20, 2005, despite its insistence upon an end to North Korea's nuclear activities, is in reality a major sign of significant regional trends that betoken a significant loss of U.S. power over the issues connected with security on the Korean peninsula. This agreement represents the first tangible outcome of the growing distancing of the ROK and the United States, and thus the fraying of their alliance. It also signifies a major diplomatic triumph for China which has forged an apparent alliance with Russia against American policy in Northeast Asia and is becoming increasingly closer to South Korea on issues relating to the Korean peninsula's security, than America. This agreement could thus represent a milestone in China's efforts to multilateralize security on the peninsula and effectuate a corresponding reduction in U.S. power in Asia. This outcome owes much to the American failure to understand and take account of regional dynamics, namely, that to be an effective player here one must have a relationship with North Korea. It also stems form the excessive partisan politicization of this issue in Congress and the Bush Administration's inability to overcome its unilateral and moralizing tendencies to forge a coherent policy among all branches of the government. Indeed, Washington spurned its interlocutors' pleas to engage North Korea directly, an engagement that would have allowed it to retain the preponderant position vis-a-vis Korean security issues that it has enjoyed since 1953. Although these talks are hardly concluded and the outcome remains uncertain, even somewhat precarious, it is clear that the prospects for a new security system in Northeast Asia, built at Washington's expense are very much in sight.",,,,Stephen.Blank@us.army.mil,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

We aimed to assess the association between herpes zoster infection and depression in the Korean population. We performed a longitudinal follow-up study of a nationwide sample cohort derived from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Individuals diagnosed with depression between 2002 and 2013 (n=58,278) as well as matched controls (n= 233,112), with both groups comprising 34.3% male and 65.7% female subjects, were extracted and analyzed for the presence of herpes zoster infection. Depression was diagnosed based on the International Classification of Diseases tenth revision (ICD-10) codes F31-F39, while herpes zoster was diagnosed as ICD-10 B02. The rate of herpes zoster infection was higher in the depressed group (6.8% [3967/58,278]) than in the control group (6.3% [14,689/233,122], P<.001). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for herpes zoster infection was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.05-1.13) in the depressed group (P<.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that the adjusted HRs for herpes zoster infection were higher only in women younger than 60 years among participants with depression. These HRs were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02-1.25; P=.016) in women younger than 40 years and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04-1.17; P<.001) in women aged 40-59 years. Depression is a predictor of herpes zoster infection in Korean women younger than 60 years.","[Choi, Hyo Geun] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Anyang, South Korea; [Kim, Eui-Joong] Eulji Univ, Eulji Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Young Kyung; Kim, Miyoung] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, Anyang, South Korea",Hallym University; Eulji University; Hallym University,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Hallym Univ, Sacred Heart Hosp, Dept Lab Med, 22 Gwanpyeong Ro,170 Beon Gil, Anyang Si 14068, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",rabbit790622@gmail.com,"Choi, Hyo/K-4461-2019; Kim, Miyoung/C-8316-2012",,,,,,30,30,32,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),OCT,2019,98,40,,,,,,,e17430,10.1097/MD.0000000000017430,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000017430,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,JF4HM,31577760,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000491348400066,View Full Record in Web of Science

This term was coined to explain a religious hybrid that was produced by the intermingling of American Evangelical Protestant Christianity, the concept of hygiene (germ theory) and indigenous Korean religiosity. This research deals with a historical process of making 'a medicalized religion' in Asia from a perspective of postcolonialism. Most of the early American Protestant missionaries in Korea were medical doctors who were influenced by the Germ theory of illness and considered Western medicine as an efficient tool to evangelize the country. As a result of their mission, a religious culture which emphasized washing away sins from the soul as analogous to washing away germs from the body was born. In addition, the Korean people developed a very unique form of public bathing ritual centered in the development of public baths to alleviate anxiety and to destabilize the solid strategies of the Japanese and the Americans, the two major colonial powers in Korea's history in the late 19th century.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Theol, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Kim, SK (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Theol, 120 New S, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",skk25@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,16,1,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0022-4197,1573-6571,,J RELIG HEALTH,J.

Regarding the 12.28 Agreement, the Japanese media seems to have two traits. First, the Japanese media is not homogeneous, and the differences between the liberals and conservatives are straightforward. Whereas the liberal media emphasizes cooperation and the essence of the agreement between two countries, conservative newspapers limit the responsibility of problem-solving to the Korean government and emphasize the framing of a final, irreversible settlement. Second, despite the variety of opinions within Japan on the matter, an overwhelming view exists in Korea where the conservative viewpoint of the Japanese newspapers is magnified and mass reproduced. This influence is on behalf of the conservative Japanese newspapers, namely Sankei Shimbun, more frequently reporting on the comfort women issue with the intention of impacting nationalism upon the public and arousing diplomatic concerns. We can assume the Korean media frequently take quotes from these reports, therefore creating a mechanism of an increase in opinions from the Japanese conservatives within the Korean media. Moreover, the changes in Japan's media environment and the strategies of Japanese conservative politicians are combined to create the phenomenon of Japanese Liberalism, which still resides, yet simply fails to reach the Korean society.","[Park, Myung-Hee] Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Ctr Japanese Studies, Inst Foreign Affairs & Natl Secur, Seoul, South Korea",,"Park, MH (corresponding author), Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Ctr Japanese Studies, Inst Foreign Affairs & Natl Secur, Seoul, South Korea.",himhpark@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,1,1,13,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2017,48,3,,,,,489,512,,,,,,24,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,FT6MQ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000423268700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: The sample included 1,739 Koreans aged over 65 yr from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2016) who reported no limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at baseline (2006) and had complete data for other covariates. ADL, IADL, socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-condition data were collected and analyzed using multiple logistic regression models. Results: The 10-yr incidence rates of ADL and IADL disability in subjects with no disability at baseline were 11.6% and 21.6%, respectively. After adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-condition factors, the incidence of ADL disability was higher in women (odds ratio [OR] =1.418, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.102-2.613) and increased with age (OR=1.170, 95% CI=1.133-1.208), multi-morbidity (OR=1.194, 95% CI=1.0151.406), and obesity (OR=1.563, 95% CI=1.057-2.311). It decreased in subjects living alone (OR=0.531, 95% CI=0.328-0.856). The incidence of IADL disability increased with age (OR=1.131, 95% CI=1.102-1.161), multimorbidity (OR=1.199, 95% CI=1.054-1.365), and cognitive disability (OR=1.422, 95% CI=1.083-1.866) and decreased for subjects living alone (OR=0.484, 95% CI=0.328-0.715) and with overweight (OR=0.725, 95% CI=0.532-0.988). Conclusion: Incidence rates of disability differed considerably based on socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-condition factors. These results suggest the importance of identifying factors that can decrease the risk of disability in this group and of prevention efforts in populations with a higher disability risk.","[Kim, Seonho] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Nursing Sci, Cheongju, South Korea; [Kim, Myoungsuk] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Nursing, Chuncheon Si, South Korea; [Han, Dallong] Cheongju Univ, Coll Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Cheongju, South Korea",Chungbuk National University; Kangwon National University; Cheongju University,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Nursing, Chuncheon Si, South Korea.;Han, DL (corresponding author), Cheongju Univ, Coll Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Cheongju, South Korea.",cellylife@gmail.com; dhan@cju.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,8,8,0,8,IRANIAN SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY,TEHRAN,"SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH & INST HEALTH RESEARCH, TEHRAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES, P O BOX 6446-14155, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",2251-6085,2251-6093,,IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH,Iran J.

The dependent variable is the trade volume, and the independent variables are general economic factors such as gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, distance, and FTA. Findings - The trade pattern of Korea's commodities shows that GDP has a positive relationship with trade, import, and export. Distance has a significant negative relationship with total trade, import, and export. FTA is significant for import but it is not significant for total trade and export. The trade pattern of China's commodities shows that GDP has a significant positive relationship with total trade, import, and export. Distance has a negative relationship with trade, import, and export. GDP per capita is not significant for total trade and import, but it is significant for export.

It consists of three categories: (1) identity, (2) diversity and pluralism, and (3) social justice. The second frame is the multicultural description analysis frame (MDAF) which shows the perspectives from which the content is described. This frame consists of five categories: (1) balance of material distribution, (2) accuracy and scope of information, (3) distortion and stereotypes, (4) balance in perspectives, and (5) Korean-ethnic centredness.

Specifically, it investigates the case of Korea during 1998-2005, when the national economy experienced fairly dramatic upsurge of start-ups and related changes. The paper argues that a national economy may achieve significant structural changes when diverse conditions are in place, including not only intentional efforts, e. g. governmental policies, but factors of serendipity triggering potential disruption to the economy, e. g. an external shock such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997. During the observation period, Korea went through notable changes in terms of entrepreneurship. Although limited, the Korean economy looks at possibilities of having small and medium-sized companies co-evolve with large ones such as chaebols.","[Moskovitch, Idan; Kim, Dong-Jae] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Sodaemoon Ku, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, DJ (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Sodaemoon Ku, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",dkim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This is especially important for people with disabilities, but the employment of disabled people in many countries is subject to significant barriers. This study examines the actual state of employment of people with mobility disabilities in Korea and which characteristics affect employment among people with mobility disabilities. Analysis of responses to the Community Integration Questionnaire and independent variables among the study participants showed that the rate of employment among people with mobility disabilities (34.2%) is much lower than that of the general population (60.3%), with only 13.2% in full-time positions. Gender appeared to be a statistically significant factor influencing employment. Other demographic characteristics such as age, level of education and cohabitation did not influence employment in this study, but people with less severe disability had a higher probability of being employed. Disability acceptance appeared to be a vital factor in the process of vocational rehabilitation. The use of vocational rehabilitation services did not have a significant effect on employment. These results suggest that the role of the formal services system in the employment process of disabled people is insufficient.","Int Relat & Educ Ctr, Seoul 110745, South Korea; Daejin Univ, Dept Social Welfare, Pochon, South Korea; Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Social Welfare, Seoul, South Korea",Daejin University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Henderson, T (corresponding author), Int Relat & Educ Ctr, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3-Ga,Human & Social Sci Campus, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",thenderson@skku.edu,,,,,,,28,14,14,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0342-5282,,,INT J REHABIL RES,Int.

One hundred and twenty Korean, Korean-American and Caucasian-American children, ages 8 to 11, and their parents participated in this study. Generally, the Korean children were perceived as behaving in a more controlled, less self-reliant and internalizing manner than were the American children. The Korean American children were rated to have more adjustment difficulties. The notion of Korean family collectivism versus western individualism and the inherent conflict in these cultural values was used to discuss the results. Practitioners should be aware that ratings with the BASC PRS and SRP scales of Korean and Korean American children can be influenced by culture to a significant degree. Also it appears that the BASC SRP and PRS are sensitive to conflict created in children and families caught between cultures, particularly related to demands for rapid Americanization.","Bluffton Univ, Bluffton, OH 45817 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Psychol Program, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University System of Ohio; Bluffton University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Jung, WS (corresponding author), Bluffton Univ, Univ Dr, Bluffton, OH 45817 USA.",jungw@bluffton.edu; tas@okstate.edu,,,,,,,20,10,13,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-0343,,,SCHOOL PSYCHOL INT,Sch.

Specifically, it examines newspaper discourses from Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and China concerning the high popularity of a transnationalized Korean drama, Dae Jang-geum, across those societies. By adopting a quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis, the article investigates both report types and news coverage topics, as well as how each society's newspapers appraise the drama's popularity and that of the Korean wave in relation to their own society. As a result, the research illuminates the differences and similarities between both the forms and contents of the various newspaper discourses. Simultaneously, it reveals how the discursive practices of newspapers differently situate and localize this Korean drama in their own social contexts.

Heterogeneous in nature, this phenomenon re-invents itself to suit local taste cultures and preexisting modes of consumption and distribution.

While the analyses of this paper clearly show the formation and evolutionary process and progression of the international trade discipline in Korea, the movements to reexamine, revamp, or mature the discipline are not apparent today. Discovered through the exploration of this paper, the fact that international trade as a discipline is losing strength in the institutional realm, remains in the domain of its parent discipline's research paradigm, and lacks self-evaluation is noticeable and challenging. Despite the problems and indolence of the current state of the discipline, this paper argues that the contemporary trend of the international trade environment provides a great opportunity to mature the discipline. However, the possibility of the discipline perishing exists if the status quo remains unchanged.","[Park, Jong-Sam] Namseoul Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Cheonan, South Korea; [Kim, Dongho] SUNY Empire State Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY USA",Namseoul University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College,"Park, JS (corresponding author), Namseoul Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Cheonan, South Korea.",kimdonho1@msn.com; jspark@nsu.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Through research published in the Korean Journal of Medical History and other journals, the course through which medicine in Korea in the modern times has been formed and the content of medicine that composed that course are elucidated. This article concludes that the various research tend to posit the view that the modern history of medicine in Korea evolves through a process of accommodation with Western medicine rather than being a complete transplantation of Western medicine, and describes medicine as it is viewed by consumers rather than the operators of medicine. How government power or colonial power utilized medicine in order to stabilize their rule is also a common theme. Now, it is come time to interrogate the viewpoints and analytical methods of medical history studies. Given that medicine is one area that drives changes in Korea in contemporary times, the outcomes obtained through this field can be sufficiently utilized when studying other areas. For instance, agony over the modernity of missionary medicine being studied recently provides meaningful implications in understanding the modernity of Korea. However, the importance of substantiation should not be overlooked as theories not supported by thorough documentary evidence are weak.","Yonsei Univ, Dept Med Hist, Coll Med, Seoul 120752, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Park, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Med Hist, Coll Med, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",wowbbona@hanmail.net,,,,,,,3,2,2,0,2,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"YONSEI UNIV COLL MED, DEPT MED HIST, 50-1 YONSEI-RO, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 03722, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relation of CRP with suicidal behavior in the Korean population. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 4693 Korean adults aged 20-81 years who participated in the 2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High sensitivity CRP levels were measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were assessed by using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed in 2017. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 4.9% and that of suicide attempt was 0.4%. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in the highest compared with the lowest serum CRP quartile (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11-2.89) after adjustment for age, sex, household income, educational level, marital status, employment status, alcohol dependency, current smoking, physical activity, BMI, sleep duration, number of chronic diseases, restriction on activity, subjective health status, perceived stress, depression and depressive mood (p for trend <0.05).

We examine meanings, expectations and desires that unmarried women in their 20s and mid-30s attach to marriage and independence, particularly focusing on heterogeneity in those subjective concepts among unmarried women of different socioeconomic status (ses). Although low-ses women perceive the pathway to marriage to be primarily determined by their own decision because of the lack of economic and emotional support from their parents, their prospects of economic security through marriage are dimmed with their poor human capital and high chance to marry similarly low-ses men. This pattern of precarious independence among low-ses women is contrasted to active and extensive parental intervention and support that high- ses unmarried women expect in marriage process. To achieve residential independence and economic security through marriage, high- ses unmarried women are willing to work together with parents. We discuss implications of these different conceptions of marriage and independence in relation to adulthood among unmarried women in Korea.","[Kim, Bo-Hwa] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Womens Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jae Kyung] Ewha Womans Univ, Womens Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Hyunjoon] Univ Penn, Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Ewha Womans University; Ewha Womans University; University of Pennsylvania,"Kim, BH (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Womens Studies, Seoul, South Korea.;Lee, JK (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Womens Studies, Seoul, South Korea.;Park, H (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kbohwa@naver.com; ljk@ewha.ac.kr; hypark@sas.upenn.edu,,,Academy of Korean - Korean Government (MEST) [AKS-2010-DZZ-2101],"Academy of Korean - Korean Government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of Korea)",Hyunjoon Park acknowledges support from the Academy of Korean Studies Grant funded by the Korean Government (MEST) (AKS-2010-DZZ-2101).,,34,13,15,0,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1568-4849,1568-5314,,ASIAN J SOC SCI,Asian J.

A National Health Promotion Fund was established, financed through tobacco taxes, which is now one of the largest in the world. However, despite abundant financial resources, the infrastructure needed to plan, implement, coordinate and evaluate health promotion efforts is still underdeveloped. Currently, health promotion capacity mapping efforts are emerging in Korea. Two international capacity mapping tools have been used to assess the Korean situation, namely HP-Source and the Health Promotion Capacity Profile, which was developed prior to the sixth Global Conference of Health Promotion, held in August 2005 in Bangkok, Thailand. The article summarizes and discusses the results of the capacity mapping exercise, highlights its challenges and suggest ways to improve the accuracy of health promotion capacity mapping.","Yonsei Univ, Healthy City Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Welf, Wonju, South Korea; Seoul Metropolitan Govt, Div Hlth Promot, Seoul, South Korea; Univ Munich, Inst Med Informat Biostat & Epidemiol, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Yonsei University; University of Munich,"Nam, EW (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Healthy City Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Welf, Wonju, South Korea.",ewnam@yonsei.ac.kr,"Engelhardt, Katrin/IQR-5668-2023",,,,,,24,10,11,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0957-4824,1460-2245,,HEALTH PROMOT INT,Health Promot.

It compares potential effects of changes in trade and domestic policy to baseline projections to 2015. Beverage milk continues to be supplied from domestic sources, implying imports compete in the manufacture of tradable products. We model manufactured dairy product supply, demand, and trade on a milk fat and non-fat-solid component basis reflecting product fungibility over the 10-year horizon used for our trade policy analysis. We find that if the domestic price support is removed with no change in trade policy, the market price of raw milk falls by about 2% and raw milk production declines by 4.5%. Under substantial tariff cuts of 30-40% with no effective change in domestic dairy policy, Korean fat and non-fat-solid prices fall by 7% and 11%, fat and non-fat-solid imports rise by 9% and 7% and Korea raw milk production falls by about 2% relative to the baseline.

Based on five key economic characteristics in the Korean mobile market, a simple model for double marginalization in the telecommunication market is introduced. Evidence was found to suggest that a double, marginalization problem is likely to exist within Korea's telecommunication industry as it is presently structured, and that this problem is further likely to have an adverse effect on the industry by inflating the price of fixed-to-mobile calls. Two alternatives are proposed to effectively remedy this double marginalization issue. It is also shown that prices of fixed-to-mobile calls could be lowered by changing the caller pays principle into a receiver pays principle. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using evidence from the Korean cases, the paper challenges the state-centric, linear, and static views of educational policy transfer, and proposes a new conceptualisation which involves multiple actors from different levels including international, domestic, and individual players. While the educational reforms in the two Koreas were developed by the Soviet and US military in order to maximise their long-term security interests in the Korean peninsula, the key actors who implemented the reforms were Korean policy-makers, who had been appointed to key positions of the educational administrations through the bureaucratic politics between the military authorities and the Korean polity. Thus, specific programmes and policies for implementation of the reforms depended on the Korean policy-makers' understanding and interpretations of the different ideologies of the Soviet Union and the USA.","[Kim, Sun] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Peace & Unificat Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Peace & Unificat Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",sun1024@hotmail.com,,,,,,,54,4,4,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

Previous literature tends to highlight the sufferings and difficulties that female refugees experience as they leave their homelands and settle in a new country. Few studies have been directed toward the political dimension of refugee life. The empirical results show that North Korean women defectors hold generally participatory attitudes toward politics and mostly liberal opinions on policy issues. Furthermore, among the socio-demographic variables, age and marital status are generally influential in the intention of political participation among the North Korean women defectors. Among the political attitudinal variables, attitude toward environmental policy consistently affects political participation intention. With respect to defector-specific variables, satisfaction with life in South Korea is influential, whereas cultural adaptation is not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines what factors are most closely associated with literacy competence by inspecting Korean heritage learners' language and literacy practice patterns and their literacy performance. Using language background surveys and Korean writing samples gathered from 56 Korean-English bilingual students in grades 4-12 and university undergraduates, it was discovered that participants' levels of Korean literacy were positively associated with home Korean language use and focused Korean language practice, whereas they were negatively correlated with years of US stay, years of schooling in the USA, and home English language use. A regression analysis revealed that the quality and range of HL practice was the only significant predictor of HL literacy skills. In addition, a one-way ANOVA indicated no significant difference for HL writing scores across four age groups (i.e. elementary school, middle school, high school, and college), which implies that HL literacy does not necessarily develop or accumulate with cognitive maturity or length of schooling, a finding dissimilar to conventional native language and literacy development.","[Kim, Catherine E.] Univ Pacific, Coll Educ, ESOL Bilingual TESOL Program, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA; [Pyun, Danielle O.] Ohio State Univ, Dept East Asian Languages & Literatures, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Pyun, Danielle O.] Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Int Educ, Seoul, South Korea",University of the Pacific; Pacific University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Kyung Hee University,"Kim, CE (corresponding author), Univ Pacific, Coll Educ, ESOL Bilingual TESOL Program, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA.",catherinekim@pacificu.edu,"Kim, Catherine/AAD-1327-2020",,,,,,44,28,35,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0790-8318,1747-7573,,LANG CULT CURRIC,Lang.

Yet, the global emergence of Korean pop music or K-pop suggests a different narrative, particularly given that its growth was largely unexpected among industry experts. Understanding the key to its international breakthrough can thus produce meaningful lessons for the music industries of other countries for their own further take-off. This constitutes the focus for this paper. Digitization has influenced various sectors of the Korean music industry such as business, society, and consumers. It has also transformed the management focus of the industry from analog to digital, from offline to online, from albums to songs, from specialization to integration, from domestic providers to international suppliers, from audio sound to visual images, from possessing to accessing, and from limited integration to synergistic network. This signifies that embracing technology advancement can enhance the competitiveness of cultural industries.","[Parc, Jimmyn] Sci Po Paris, Paris Sch Int Affairs PSIA, Paris, France; [Parc, Jimmyn] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Commun Res, Seoul 150599, South Korea; [Kim, Shin Dong] Hallym Univ, Media Sch, Chunchon 24252, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Hallym University,"Kim, SD (corresponding author), Hallym Univ, Media Sch, Chunchon 24252, South Korea.",jimmynparc@gmail.com; shinkim.sk@gmail.com,"Parc, Jimmyn/AAD-4706-2020","Parc, Jimmyn/0000-0002-4836-460X",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2015-LAB-2250003]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5B4A01037022],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",Jimmyn Parc's work was supported by the Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2015-LAB-2250003); Shin Dong Kim's work and the article processing charges (APC) for this paper were supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A5B4A01037022).,,50,26,31,13,118,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,18,,,,,,,7790,10.3390/su12187790,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187790,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OJ9HM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000584265300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A screening survey using the Korean version of ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) was conducted between 2007 and 2008, and clinical interviews by a pediatric psychiatrist were performed for selected children between 2009 and 2010. A total of 49,573 elementary school students, between ages of 7 and 12, constituted the target population, among which 38,365 students (77.2%) and respective parents gave consent to participate. Of the participants, 200 screened children were clinically examined to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD. We estimated the prevalence of ADHD and its comorbidity in the population, after adjusting for nonresponse and nonparticipation. The prevalence of ADHD was 11.7% in boys and 5.2% in girls, with an overall prevalence of 8.5%. The combined type of inattentive and hyperactive was the most frequent at 4.7% of the whole population. Children were more likely to have ADHD if their parents were separated and had less education. Most commonly combined comorbidity was autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (10.1%). The prevalence of ADHD in the school-aged population is an essential information for improving the quality of public health mental services for evaluation and treatment of ADHD.","[Kim, Moon Jung] Seonam Univ, Myongji Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Coll Med, Goyang, South Korea; [Park, Inho] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Nat Sci, Busan, South Korea; [Lim, Myung Ho; Paik, Ki Chung] Dankook Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Cheonan, South Korea; [Lim, Myung Ho; Paik, Ki Chung; Cho, Sungja; Kwon, Ho-Jang; Yoo, Seung-Jin; Ha, Mina] Dankook Univ, Ctr Environm Hlth, Med Ctr, Cheonan, South Korea; [Kwon, Ho-Jang; Ha, Mina] Dankook Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, 201 Manghyang Ro, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Gyu] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hosp Management, Seoul, South Korea",Myongji Hospital; Seonam University; Pukyong National University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Ha, M (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, 201 Manghyang Ro, Cheonan 31116, South Korea.",minaha@dku.edu,"; Lee, Sang Gyu/JQV-6912-2023; Kim, Yoon/G-6633-2015","Ha, Mina/0000-0003-1011-9446; Kwon, Ho-Jang/0000-0003-3029-5674; Park, Inho/0000-0002-4216-915X; Lee, Sang Gyu/0000-0003-4847-2421; Cho, SungJa/0000-0001-9673-6976; Kim, Moon Jung/0000-0003-4148-9116; Yoo, Seung-Jin/0000-0002-0643-5609;","Ministry of Environment, Korea","Ministry of Environment, Korea(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the Ministry of Environment, Korea.",,27,28,34,1,7,KOREAN ACAD MEDICAL SCIENCES,SEOUL,"4F, 37 Ichon-ro 46-Gil, Yongsan-gu, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",1011-8934,1598-6357,,J KOREAN MED SCI,J.

Method: Using a cross-sectional correlational design, data were collected from 886 nursing students in two nursing schools. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and hierarchical multiple regressions with SPSS version 18. Results: Nursing students had moderate levels of intent to migrate. Variables that were independently associated with intention to migrate were class year and having previously considered the possibility of overseas employment on admission to nursing school. The full model accounted for 45.1% of the variance in intention to migrate. Conclusion: The most significant predictor of intent to migrate by nursing students was the possibility of overseas employment on admission to nursing school. To more positively manage the intent to migrate, appropriate strategies to enhance the nursing work environment should be investigated.","[Lee, Eunjoo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Daegu, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU),"Lee, E (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Res Inst Nursing Sci, 101 Dong In Dong Jung Gu, Daegu 700422, South Korea.",jewelee@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,8,10,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1043-6596,1552-7832,,J TRANSCULT NURS,J.

Although several studies have explored the relationship between cognition, depression, and oral health in older adults, the exact nature and direction of this relationship are poorly understood. Moreover, most studies to date have been cross-sectional, with fewer longitudinal studies. The current longitudinal study explored the relationship between cognition, depression, and oral health in older adults. Methods: We used data from two waves (2018, 2020) of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, which included 4543 older adults aged 60 years and older. General socio-demographic characteristics were analyzed using descriptive analysis, and study variables were described using t-tests. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and cross-lagged models were used to examine the longitudinal associations between cognition, depression, and oral health.Results: The GEE results suggested that better cognition and less depression over time were associated with better oral health in older adults. Cross-lagged models further validated the effect of depression on oral health over time.Limitations: The directionality of the influence of cognition on oral health could not be determined. Conclusions: Although there were several limitations, our study provided novel ideas for verifying the effects of cognition and depression on oral health in older adults.","[Zhao, Bo; Nam, Eun Woo] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Hlth Adm, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Wonju 26493, South Korea; [Zhao, Bo; Nam, Eun Woo] Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Global Hlth Ctr, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Wonju 26493, South Korea; [Jiang, Xiaoxu; Kong, Fanlei] Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Ctr Hlth Management & Policy Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Jinan 250012, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xiaoxu; Kong, Fanlei] Shandong Univ, NHC Key Lab Hlth Econ & Policy Res, Jinan 250012, Peoples R China",Yonsei University; Yonsei University; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Nam, EW (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Hlth Adm, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Wonju 26493, South Korea.;Kong, FL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Ctr Hlth Management & Policy Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Jinan 250012, Peoples R China.",kongfanlei@sdu.edu.cn; ewnam@yonsei.ac.kr,"JIANG, xx/KHV-3752-2024; Zhao, Bo/AAP-1850-2021","Zhao, Bo/0000-0002-6780-1633;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71804094]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2022KJGL01],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Funding This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 71804094] and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [No. 2022KJGL01] .,,75,6,6,5,88,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-0327,1573-2517,,J AFFECT DISORDERS,J.

The study highlights the changes that took place after the election of President Yoon Suk-yeol in 2022, which marked a significant diplomatic shift compared to the previous administration, fostering rapprochement through strategic alignment and increased trilateral cooperation involving the United States. The role of the U.S. and convergence in security cooperation, particularly in relation to North Korea's threats, has been a major factor in consolidating bilateral rapprochement. However, unresolved historical grievances, particularly related to forced labor and wartime sexual slavery, have repeatedly influenced diplomatic interactions and public sentiment, leading to persistent domestic opposition especially in Korea. In addition, political transitions in both countries underline the fragility of recent diplomatic achievements. The article argues that sustainable improvement in bilateral relations necessitates institutional frameworks addressing historical controversies and domestic political challenges, supported by robust trilateral cooperation to enhance regional stability.","[Milani, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dept Arts, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Milani, M (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Arts, Bologna, Italy.",marco.milani6@unibo.it,"Milani, Marco/KHV-5154-2024",,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,SPR,2025,56,1,,,,,137,159,,10.29152/KOIKS.2025.56.1.137,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2025.56.1.137,,,23,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,1WD7R,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001475081300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To solve the security puzzle, this paper employs a Gramscian approach and argues that the reconciliation was pursued as hegemonic projects by the ruling political groups in North and South Korea. In South Korea, the economic crisis in 1997 led counter-hegemonic liberal nationalists to take political power, and the new ruling political group implemented the engagement policy toward Pyongyang to attain hegemony. In North Korea, the existing ruling political group sought to reconcile with Seoul, mostly for material gains to maintain hegemony by stopping the ongoing economic crisis from developing into a political crisis without a full-scale reform of the system. In the process, each capitalized on unification nationalism, which had a strong national-popular force because of the division of Korea. The rapprochement was carried out primarily to exhibit their contributions to unification, which could be significantly conducive to their winning the domestic struggle for hegemony.","[Choi, Yong Sub] Sangmyung Univ, Sangmyung Inst Secur & Unificat, Seoul, South Korea",Sangmyung University,"Choi, YS (corresponding author), Sangmyung Univ, Sangmyung Inst Secur & Unificat, Seoul, South Korea.",willphin@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,2,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

This study examines the characteristics of hardcore smokers in South Korea. Methods: We used the data from 2007 to 2013 from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Hardcore smoking was defined as (1) smoking >15 cigarettes per day, (2) having no plans of quitting, and (3) having made no attempts to quit. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the association between various sociodemographic variables and hardcore smoking. Results: The proportion of hardcore smokers among smokers did not change significantly from 23.1% in 2007 to 23.0% in 2013. None of the three characteristics of hardcore smokers for either gender showed a significant change from 2007 to 2013. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hardcore smokers were 1.64 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.11) greater among those aging 40-49 years than among those aging 19-29 years, and four times greater among men than women. Never-married smokers were less likely to be hardcore smokers than married ones (odds ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96). Household income and education level did not have any significant association with the likelihood of a hardcore smoker. Conclusions: Hardcore smoking was more prevalent among men, unmarried men and those aging 40-49 years.","[Kang, EunKyo; Lee, Jung A.; Cho, Hong-Jun] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Seoul, South Korea",University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center,"Cho, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Seoul, South Korea.",hjcho@amc.seoul.kr,,"Kang, EunKyo/0000-0001-5844-5625",,,,,28,13,13,0,3,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,MAY 26,2017,17,,,,,,,,521,10.1186/s12889-017-4452-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4452-z,,,7,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",EX1YM,28549442,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000403022700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach-In the paper hypotheses are tested with a regression model using a survey data collected from 107 MBA students at a business school in South Korea. Findings-The paper finds that the three network externality factors have different effects on the users' future usage intention for the four Internet services. Local network size is significant for online messenger services, local network size and network strength are significant for online community services, and total network size is significant for chat room services. For email services, none of the network externality factors are significant. Research limitationshinplications-The paper shows that a total network size is an important network externality factor affecting the success of a network. However, users' satisfaction with network services and two additional network externality factors, local network size and network strength, are also important determinants. To generalize the finding, investigations into other network services in other environments and into some offline networks are necessary.

Breaking down the shocks into six, we analyzed how each shock affects the macroeconomy and gasoline market in Korea. Results of the analysis revealed that the oil supply shock did not cause a large fluctuation in gasoline prices, but it harmed the macroeconomy. By contrast, the two shocks on the demand side of the GCO market caused a large increase in domestic gasoline prices, but they did not negatively affect the macroeconomy. Meanwhile, in the KG market, gasoline-refining shock and gasoline demand shock caused a significant increase in gasoline prices. Both shocks had some negative effects on the Korean macroeconomy at a certain point, but the effects are not as strong as the oil supply shock. However, the gasoline distribution shock in Korea rarely caused negative consequences for major macroeconomic variables. Moreover, analyzing the KG prices through historical decomposition, we found that the two demand-side factors of the GCO market and the demand shock of the KG market have had the most important influence on the gasoline price since the 2000s. From the analysis, the increase in gasoline prices in Korea since the 2000s can be inferred to have no significant negative impact on the macroeconomy. Therefore, the essential factors of price fluctuations must be focused on in analyzing domestic gasoline price and their impact on the macroeconomy.","[Lee, Jihoon; Cho, Hong Chong] Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Cho, HC (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",wlgns5749@gmail.com; hongcho@dankook.ac.kr,,"Cho, Hong Chong/0000-0002-2034-5343; Lee, Jihoon/0000-0002-8478-2120",Research-Focused Department Promotion Project as a part of the University Innovation Support Program 2020,Research-Focused Department Promotion Project as a part of the University Innovation Support Program 2020,"This research has been done by the author(s) working at the Department of Economics at Dankook University, which was supported by the Research-Focused Department Promotion Project as a part of the University Innovation Support Program 2020 to Dankook University.",,77,5,5,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,2209,10.3390/su13042209,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042209,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ9EU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000624821300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data were analyzed using two-stage hierarchical regression analysis. The results showed that emotional self-encouragement (13 = -0.43, p = .004) and gratitude (13 = -0.22, p = .029) were factors significantly influencing depression. The regression model explained 28.0% of depression. Therefore, it is recommended that mental health nurses provide intervention to psychiatric inpatients to help them foster gratitude and emotional self-encouragement so that they can decrease depression.","[Kim, Ju Yeon; Jun, Won Hee] Keimyung Univ, Coll Nursing, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Jun, WH (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Coll Nursing, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",jwh9178@hanmail.net,,,,,,,42,4,4,1,11,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0883-9417,1532-8228,,ARCH PSYCHIAT NURS,Arch.

Methods This survey involved 68,043 adolescents who participated in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey conducted in 2015. The data were analyzed using the PASW Statistics 23.0 program. Results The subjects were aged 14.96 +/- 1.74 years (mean +/- standard deviation), including 52.1% male subjects and 53.0% high school students. Most of the drinkers started drinking during their middle school years (13,906 students, 51.6%). Among the 11,021 adolescent drinkers, 7,391 (67.1%) reported at least one of six behavioral problems related to drinking. Problem drinking behaviors involved (a) drinking alcohol to relieve stress; (b) drinking alcohol alone; (c) receiving advice from family or friends to reduce alcohol consumption; (d) driving a motorcycle or riding a bicycle after drinking alcohol, or riding on a motorcycle or a car with a drunk driver at the steering wheel; (e) memory loss after drinking alcohol; and (f) arguing with others after drinking alcohol. The overall problem-drinking score was 1.36 +/- 1.42 (range: 0-6). A regression model that included individual (5.7%), interpersonal (3.6%), social (0.3%), contextual (11.7%), and drinking (6.6%) behaviors as predictors accounted for 27.9% of the variance in problem drinking (WaldF= 70.10,p< .001). Conclusion The drinking levels as well as method and ease of alcohol purchase were the most significant variables predicting problem drinking by adolescents in Korea.","[Cho, Mi-Kyoung] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Nursing Sci, Coll Med, Cheongju, South Korea; [Kim, Mi Young] Hanyang Univ, Coll Nursing, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Chungbuk National University; Hanyang University,"Kim, MY (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Coll Nursing, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",miyoung0@hanyang.ac.kr,"Cho, Mi-Kyoung/AAX-7541-2021",,Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,The authors received financial support for research by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016.,,32,1,1,0,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1088-4602,1548-7148,,J ADDICT NURS,J.

Key officials in Washington possessed negative perceptions of Korea that influenced their policymaking on an ideological level. These men perceived Korea to be a backward country averse to progress and generally believed that Japan should guide Korea to civilization. This article suggests that Washington's perceptions of Korea were firmly rooted in a cultural discourse on Korea, which was shaped largely by dominant representations of Korea in popular texts of the period. Representations of Korea in newspaper articles and commercial texts were influenced by Americans' early hostile encounters with the hermit nation, colored by ethnographic descriptions of Korea's backwardness, and informed by racial stereotypes and the ideologies of imperialism prevalent in the West. It was also mediated by Japanese information channels. These texts generated a popular discourse on Korea that likely impacted Washington's perceptions of Korea and conditioned its pro-Japan policy. They help to explain the perceptual rift that developed between policyrnakers in Washington and the American diplomatic community in Korea. In focusing on the nature and origins of the early American discourse on Korea, the purpose of this article is to contribute to scholarship on early U.S.-Korean relations by exploring how cultural facts may have conditioned U.S. foreign policy in Korea. It also aims to start a conversation about public awareness of Korea during the period and the importance of public opinion as a political force in the United States.",,,"Johnson, AS (corresponding author), Give2Asia, San Francisco, CA USA.",andrewj1@stanford.edu,,,,,,,18,5,6,0,11,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2011,51,4,,,,,110,131,,,,,,22,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,874SL,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000298978300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study attempts to develop an integrated senior citizen-oriented healthcare service system in which daily care, professional care, and rehabilitation are organically organized between medical institutions and local communities, thereby meeting the daily life needs of the elderly and inducing well-being, wellness, and well-dying. Methods: To develop the integrated healthcare system, data collection and analyses were conducted through a systematic review, literature review, benchmarking, focus group interviews, and expert consultation. Results: The senior-specific, citizen-oriented healthcare service system developed in this study is designed to screen patients aged 65 or older within 24 h of being admitted, using the Geriatric Screening for Care-10. If there is reason for concern as a result of the screening, further evaluation is performed through assessment. Doctors and nurses create a care plan and a discharge plan based on the results from the screening and assessment. The nurse further uses the screening to monitor the patient's condition before discharge. Based on the screening results at the time of discharge, a transitional care plan is prepared and provided to elderly patients and/or their families. This process enables a systematic link between medical institutions and community resources, aiming for the continuous management of health issues. It also establishes a multidisciplinary treatment plan that considers patients and their families so that diseases common to the elderly are diagnosed and treated promptly. Conclusions: The most important issue for the elderly is to be able to live healthily and independently for the rest of their lives through well-being, wellness, and well-dying. The senior-specific, citizen-oriented healthcare service proposed in this study is an integrated medical treatment system for elderly users the implementation of which requires the daily care, professional care, and rehabilitation of elderly members of society to be organically organized according to the role of the patients, their families, and the caregiver.","[Kim, Yoon-Sook; Lee, Jongmin; Moon, Yeonsil; Kim, Hee Joung; Shin, Jinyoung; Uhm, Kyeong Eun; Kim, Kyoung Jin; Yoo, Jung A.; Oh, Yun Kyoung; Byeon, Pilsuk; Han, Seol-Heui; Choi, Jaekyung] Konkuk Univ, Med Ctr, 120-1 Neungdong Ro Hwayang Dong, Seoul 05030, South Korea; [Park, Jae-Min] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Gangnam Severance Hosp, 211 Eonju Ro, Seoul 06273, South Korea; [Lee, Kunsei] Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, 268 Chungwon Daero, Chungju Si 27478, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Han, Seol-Heui] Konkuk Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, 120-1 Neungdong Ro Hwayang Dong, Seoul 05030, South Korea; [Choi, Jaekyung] Konkuk Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, 120-1 Neungdong Ro Hwayang Dong, Seoul 05030, South Korea",Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center,"Han, SH; Choi, J (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, Med Ctr, 120-1 Neungdong Ro Hwayang Dong, Seoul 05030, South Korea.",alzdoc@kuh.ac.kr; cjk@kuh.ac.kr,"Kim, Nam Hoon/HNS-5794-2023; Lee, Jongmin/Q-4909-2019; Park, JaeMin/ABG-2197-2021","Park, JaeMin/0000-0001-8873-8832; Shin, Jinyoung/0000-0001-9558-1853;","Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI16C0526]","Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea","This research was supported by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: HI16C0526).",,79,8,8,2,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2318,,BMC GERIATR,BMC Geriatr.,JAN 31,2020,20,1,,,,,,,32,10.1186/s12877-019-1397-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12877-019-1397-3,,,15,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,KL6HJ,32005155,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000513522000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data for this study comes from the Korean General Social Survey (KG-SS) of 2003. Age, education, family income, and evaluations of social trust and current political and economic situations are examined as major determinants of national pride. The study finds that South Koreans exhibit greater national pride in their achievement in sports, history, and science and technology than in politics and social welfare systems. Moreover, South Koreans who are younger, better educated, or have higher family income tend to be less proud of their country and are less likely to have strong sentiments of national superiority or allegiance to the nation.","[Choe, Hyun] Cheju Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, Cheju, South Korea",Jeju National University,,chungkiseon@hanmail.net; nuni85@cheju.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,18,20,3,18,"KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES",SEOUL,"28-42 SAMCHUNG-DONG, CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-230, SOUTH KOREA",0258-9184,,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,,2008,32,1,,,,,99,127,,,,,,29,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,337IO,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000258430000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Language attitudes studies have tended to investigate reactions to distinct varieties rather than speakers' attempts to approximate new varieties for their own benefit, and while a few have considered the effects of listeners' categorization of speakers on evaluations of them, they have generally focused solely on macro-categories such as place of origin, especially in languages other than English. This study investigates South Koreans' attitudes toward North and South Koreans' native and adopted accents and how these attitudes may relate to listeners' categorization of the speakers. Eighty-two South Korean listeners rated recordings of three Korean speakers, two from different cities in North Korea and one from Busan, South Korea, who each read the same text in two versions: their native variety and their adopted Seoul variety. Listeners only consistently identified the Pyongyang variety as North Korean, but rated all three speakers more positively in Seoul guises than in their native guises. Additionally, when North Korean speakers were identified as being from outside South Korea, ratings were less positive. However, the Pyongyang speaker was rated more highly than the South Korean speaker on positive qualities, and qualitative data suggests that other types of speaker categorization may be relevant to attitudes, such as 'professional' for the Pyongyang speaker in both guises and 'youth' for the South Korean speaker in her Seoul guise. Thus, attitudes studies may benefit from qualitative data on speaker identification beyond the usual macro-categories, addressing the multiple categories indexed by a speech sample.","[Shin, Yu Kyoung] Hallym Univ, Sch Global Studies, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Lindemann, Stephanie] Georgia State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, Atlanta, GA USA; [Lindemann, Stephanie] Georgia State Univ, ESL, Atlanta, GA USA",Hallym University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Shin, YK (corresponding author), Hallym Univ, Sch Global Studies, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",yshin@hallym.ac.kr; lindemann@gsu.edu,"Lindemann, Stephanie/I-6671-2019","Shin, Yu Kyoung/0000-0002-5290-4373",,,,,41,1,1,1,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1868-6303,1868-6311,,APPL LINGUIST REV,Appl.

It seeks to establish whether a state that has overwhelmingly failed to provide basic public goods can nevertheless produce and sustain the devotion and support of some or all of the population-in other words, arouse patriotic sentiment-and if so, on what terms. The paper approaches the topic using a modified version of the International Social Survey Programme's national identity survey, specifically those questions that deal with national pride. Using survey findings and selected follow-up interviews, we examine the presence or absence of patriotic sentiment among more than 650 former residents of North Korea. The paper also takes a comparative approach, comparing North Korean patriotism findings with those from former socialist countries to determine whether any patterns exist. We find evidence that, despite enormous state failures, the North Korean state has managed to generate a sense of patriotism and accomplishment for selected components of its state and society, notably in the cultural sphere (e.g., arts and sports). Data from other former socialist states produce similar findings.","[Green, Christopher] Leiden Univ, Korean Studies, Leiden, Netherlands; [Denney, Steven] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; University of Toronto,"Green, C (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Korean Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",c.k.green@hum.leidenuniv.nl; steven.denney@utoronto.ca,,"Green, Christopher/0000-0003-2025-7631","Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2013-R11, AKS-2015-R49]; UniKorea Foundation",Academy of Korean Studies; UniKorea Foundation,"This work was supported by Academy of Korean Studies grants AKS-2013-R11 and AKS-2015-R49, and a 2018-2019 research grant from the UniKorea Foundation for the project Politics and Process of `Unification in Action.'

This complex interplay of contradictory patterns of relations makes it extremely difficult for any single nation, even if it were the world's superpower, the United States, to determine a course of action proactively. Despite the geopolitically strategic location it occupies, South Korea is no exception-a result of the inherent limitations to the makeup of its national strength and the constant threats it faces from the North. Security and defense are therefore areas of utmost attention for not only a scholar such as the author, but for all Koreans. The intention in writing this paper is to delineate the anguish and struggles Koreans are experiencing in trying to overcome internal and external security challenges, and also explain their resolve for the future.","Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea",,"Hyo-bok, B (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea.",banghb519@kida.re.kr,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,3,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

Among the initially identified 23 videos, nine were chosen based on specific criteria. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed four themes: (a) I had to negotiate between the fear of losing my family and asserting my identity, (b) I armed myself with knowledge to confront parents' prejudices, (c) my parents were initially fearful, but ultimately wanted me to be happy, and (d) it is important to be thoughtful about coming out even though it brought me closer to my family. This study underscored the complex interplay of Confucianism and Christianity as social contexts and the creators' dual strategy of employing cultural tactics and critically confronting biases in response. For Korean LGBQ YouTubers, coming out was a highly relational endeavour. This study highlighted social media's role in promoting queer visibility in South Korea. Implications include the need to develop more culturally appropriate support and resources tailored to Korean LGBQ individuals and to facilitate greater understanding and acceptance of LGBQ people among Korean parents.","[Min, Moonkyung; Coombs, Emily; Shinbine, Danielle] Univ Calgary, Werklund Sch Educ, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Chang, Eunhu; Noh, Heejin; Maroney, Meredith R.; Horne, Sharon G.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Counseling & Sch Psychol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Yi, Hyun Ji] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Quantitat Fdn, Lowa City, IA USA; [Horne, Sharon G.] Univ South Africa, Dept Psychol, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Calgary; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of South Africa,"Maroney, MR (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Counseling & Sch Psychol, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",meredith.maroney@umb.edu,,"Yi, Hyun Ji/0000-0003-0344-4187",,,,,51,1,1,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1941-9899,1941-9902,,PSYCHOL SEX,Psychol.

An analysis of 4,980 comments by Americans on two popular K-drama sites in the United States reveals that K-dramas' global appeal lies in their skillful blend of various subgenres and elements, effective execution, and incorporation of emotional appeal and unique South Korean perspectives and values into the narrative.

In its portrayal of the incidents that take place over the course of half a day in a small house where a married couple live in Busan, the text of Pusan makes abundant use of linguistic forms that serve to recreate, such as dialogue and onomatopoeia. The war in Korea, which the author did not experience first-hand, is a psychodrama that unfolds in a limited space. On the other hand, set in a Japanese naval port, the story of Son Yeong-gam takes place along a military road constructed by Koreans who had immigrated over before the war. Here, the Korean War overlaps with memories of the past war, and is recounted in a multi-layered time structure. These two short stories one connecting Zainichi Korean literature to the homeland via imagination, the other depicting a people who've lived by cutting open space and stacking layers of time show that Zainichi Korean literature encompasses the vivid history of the Korean diaspora.","[Hirata, Yumi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Japanese Studies, 5-1 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608532, Japan",University of Osaka,"Hirata, Y (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Japanese Studies, 5-1 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608532, Japan.",hirata@let.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,5,UNIVERSITAS,TAIPEI,"106 NO 96 LE-LI RD, DA AN DISTRICT, TAIPEI, 10668, TAIWAN",1015-8383,,,UNIVERSITAS-TAIWAN,UNIVERSITAS-Mon.

Not only did these opportunities provide many Korean women with basic literacy skills, but the advanced training for certified Bible Woman status represented the initial steps in women's professional education. Such professional education of Bible Women, open to women from all walks of life, was an avenue for self-betterment, professional transformation and social mobility. With a focus on theological and practical training, Bible classes, Bible institutes and Bible training schools provided women with heretofore unavailable opportunities to meet publicly with women of diverse backgrounds and to be taught and led by Korean women. Bible classes provided some of the first opportunities for professional female leadership in modern Korea and thus they portrayed a pattern of transmission of the Bible both for and by Korean women. In this way, Bible education for women deserves to be recognized as the first steps in women's leadership and professional education in modern Korean society.","[Strawn, Lee-Ellen] Yonsei Sch Theol, Seoul, South Korea; [Strawn, Lee-Ellen] Fac Seoul Foreign Sch, Seoul, South Korea",,"Strawn, LE (corresponding author), Yonsei Sch Theol, Seoul, South Korea.",lstrawn@seoulforeign.org,,,,,,,51,3,4,0,6,"INST STUDY RELIGION, SOGANG UNIV",SEOUL,"35 BAEKBEOM-RO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, 121-742, SOUTH KOREA",2093-7288,2167-2040,,J KOREAN RELIG,J.

It is clear that the EEZ is a zone that is neither territorial waters nor wholly high-seas. It is also a zone in which competencies are balanced between the need of coastal States to have sufficient authority to exploit and manage their economic resources and the need of all other States to retain high-seas navigation and communications freedoms and uses related to such freedoms. From South Korea's perspective, the EEZ is a sui generic zone in which military and intelligence activities are limited or not allowed without the consent of the coastal State. This is equally applicable in peace and war. Although several States stress that Article 58 of the 1982 UNCLOS permits such activities, increasing EW and IW capabilities may result in reinterpretation of certain provisions of the 1982 UNCLOS.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in 4633 individuals aged 20 to 81 years who participated in the 2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants are considered to have prediabetes if they have one or more of the following: impaired fasting glucose (fasting blood glucose levels between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L); impaired hemoglobin A1c (hemoglobin A1c ranges of 5.7% to 6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol]). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Prediabetes was more prevalent in the hyperuricemia group compared with the normal-range group among men (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.11-2.05; P < .01) and women (OR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.01-3.37; P = .04) after adjustment for age, body mass index, abdominal obesity, blood pressure, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, renal function, alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity level. For a standard deviation increment in uric acid, the odds of having prediabetes as compared with that of not having prediabetes increased about 114% in men (P = .05) and 116% in women (P = .01). Higher levels of uric acid were associated with an increased risk of prediabetes among the general Korean population.","[Park, Ryoung Jin; Kang, Min Gu] Gwangyang Sarang Gen Hosp, Gwangyang Si, Jeollanam Do, South Korea",,"Park, RJ (corresponding author), Gwangyang Sarang Gen Hosp, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, 71 Gongyeong Ro, Gwangyang Si 57788, Jeollanam Do, South Korea.",docomary@hanmail.net,"Lee, Heon-Jeong/K-5871-2015",,,,,,32,5,6,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1010-5395,1941-2479,,ASIA-PAC J PUBLIC HE,Asia-Pac.

This study investigates the cross-sectional relations of physical activity with suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents, simultaneously considering previously reported risk factors of suicide such as depression, stress, and body image. Methods: This study used the 2007 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS). Four hundred middle schools and 400 high schools in Korea were monitored, and 74,698 students completed the questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between physical activity and suicidal ideation and attempts, progressively adjusting for body image, depression and stress. Results: After controlling for body image, stress, and depression, the significant relationship between physical activity and suicidal ideation disappeared, and the only remaining relationship was a positive relationship between frequent vigorous physical activity and suicide attempts. No sex differences were found after adjusting for all the variables. Conclusion: Unlike the general expectation that physical activity protects adolescents from suicidal behaviors, the results from this study suggest that physical activity does not have protective effect. Korean adolescents who perform frequent vigorous physical activities are more likely to attempt suicide.","[Lee, Chung Gun] Indiana Univ, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Cho, Youngtae; Yoo, Seunghyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, CG (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"Choi, You-Jung/AFR-4193-2022",,,,,,34,17,18,1,10,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1543-3080,1543-5474,,J PHYS ACT HEALTH,J.

Unitary Korean nationalism was becoming a dominant form of discourse on inter-Korean relations and was evident in the South Korean media coverage of the Olympics. Despite this, there exists a gap between sporting nationalism and political nationalism. The mood of reconciliation between the two Koreas is less evident in politics than in sport due to the ongoing political tensions and conflicts in the Korean peninsula. Wider tensions evident in the period leading up to the London 2012 Olympic Games reinforce this conclusion.","[Maguire, Joseph] Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Lee, Jung Woo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Loughborough University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Maguire, J (corresponding author), Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Ashby Rd, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",j.a.maguire@lboro.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-0806] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,10,13,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0038-0385,,,SOCIOLOGY,Sociol.-J.

Design: Cross-sectional data analysis of a cohort study. Setting and Participants: The study used baseline data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Survey, a multicenter longitudinal study undertaken in 10 urban, rural, and suburban communities in Korea between 2016 and 2017. A total of 2917 older adults aged 70 to 84 years were included in the analysis, who were administered questionnaires and physical function tests. Methods: Gait speed and grip strength were measured, and all participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and answered questions about weight loss and exhaustion based on FFP. Results: Five questions were chosen to screen for FFP: fatigue (exhaustion), resistance (weakness), ambulation (slowness), inactivity, and loss of weight. The Frailty Phenotype Questionnaire (FPQ; range of 0-5) was well correlated with the Fried frailty scale (range of 0-5) (r = 0.643; P < .001). Frailty based on the FPQ score (>3 of 5) showed satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for FFP (area under the curve = 0.89), with high sensitivity (81.7%) and specificity (82.5%). Conclusions and Implications: The FPQ is a highly accurate screening tool for FFP in community-dwelling older adults.

However, only a few studies chronometrically investigated speech production in Korean, and they obtained mixed results. Korean is particularly interesting as there might be both phonemic and syllabic influences during phonological encoding. The purpose of this study is to further examine the initial phonological preparation unit in Korean, employing a masked priming task (Experiment 1) and a phonological Stroop task (Experiment 2). The results showed that significant onset (and onset-plus, that is, consonant-vowel [CV]) effects were found in both experiments, but there was no compelling evidence for a prominent role for the syllable. When the prime words were presented in three different forms related to the targets, namely, without any change, with re-syllabified codas, and with nasalised codas, there were no significant differences in facilitation among the three forms. Alternatively, it is also possible that participants may not have had sufficient time to process the primes up to the point that re-syllabification or nasalisation could have been carried out. In addition, the results of a Stroop task demonstrated that the onset phoneme effect was not driven by any orthographic influence. These findings suggest that the onset segment and not the syllable is the initial (or proximate) phonological unit used in the segment-to-frame encoding process during speech planning in Korean.","[Han, Jeong-Im] Konkuk Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Seoul, South Korea; [Verdonschot, Rinus G.] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, Hiroshima, Japan",Konkuk University; Hiroshima University,"Verdonschot, RG (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, Minami Ku, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan.",rinusverdonschot@gmail.com,,"Verdonschot, Rinus/0000-0002-7124-4091; Han, Jeong-Im/0000-0002-5871-5119",Konkuk University; JSPS [17K02748]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K02748] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Konkuk University; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",J.I.H. was supported by a research grant from Konkuk University (2016).

That policy involved the gradually escalating application of nonviolent means of coercion as the North Korean nuclear problem that it purported to arrest grew more acute over time. But what led the Obama administration to adopt this confrontational yet timid approach to North Korea? Using a configurational analysis, this article proposes that the Obama-era policy of strategic patience had little to do with North Korea per se, and instead derived primarily from the intersection of three different factors: the prioritization necessary as part of the US rebalance to Asia strategy; fear that South Korean aggression would pull the United States into an unwanted war in Korea; and a prevailing belief among many policymakers that the North Korean regime would eventually collapse under the pressures of its own contradictions. This combination of priorities and beliefs led the Obama administration to treat the North Korean nuclear issue seriously but not urgently, resorting to actions incommensurate with the nature of the problem.","[Jackson, Van] Victoria Univ Wellington, Int Relat, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jackson, Van] Ctr New Amer Secur, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Jackson, Van] Woodrow Wilson Int Ctr Scholars, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Jackson, Van] Ctr Strateg Studies, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jackson, Van] APCSS, Honolulu, HI USA",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Jackson, V (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Int Relat, Wellington, New Zealand.;Jackson, V (corresponding author), Ctr New Amer Secur, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Jackson, V (corresponding author), Woodrow Wilson Int Ctr Scholars, Washington, DC 20560 USA.;Jackson, V (corresponding author), Ctr Strateg Studies, Wellington, New Zealand.",vanallenjackson@gmail.com,,"Jackson, Van/0000-0002-1112-6341",Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2016-LAB-2250001],"Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This research was supported by the Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2016-LAB-2250001).,,75,2,3,0,4,"KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES",SEOUL,"28-42 SAMCHUNG-DONG, CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-230, SOUTH KOREA",0258-9184,,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,FAL,2019,43,4,,,,,593,619,,,,,,27,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,JT3XG,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000500925500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A numeral quantifier in Korean can be stranded from its modified noun through scrambling as long as the quantifier forms a constituent with the noun. For Chinese-Korean bilinguals, acquiring this structural knowledge gives rise to a learnability problem because this ability cannot be derived from the L1, not easily induced from Korean input and is not obtained through classroom instruction. In acceptability judgment, highly proficient Chinese-Korean bilinguals demonstrated target-like knowledge of this structural constraint. Results from a self-paced reading task showed that the bilinguals showed sensitivity to the violation of the mismatch between an NQ and its modified NP, both in local and non-local dependency conditions. Our findings suggest that structure-based processing is possible for highly proficient bilinguals even when the target structure is not instantiated in bilinguals' L1.","[Kim, Hyunwoo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Language Studies 2, 1890 East West Rd,Moore Hall,Rm570, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Language Studies 2, 1890 East West Rd,Moore Hall,Rm570, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",hyunwoo2@hawaii.edu,"; Kim, Hyunwoo/AAG-1091-2021","Kim, Hyunwoo/0000-0003-4810-6333;",,,,,57,8,9,1,16,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0090-6905,1573-6555,,J PSYCHOLINGUIST RES,J.

Data on children's adjustment were collected from multiple sources, including peer evaluations, teacher ratings, and children's self-reports. It was found that maternal power assertion was positively associated with children's social and school adjustment. Maternal autonomy support was positively associated with children's social and school adjustment and negatively associated with psychological problems.

This study found a similar prevalence of elder abuse in the two samples, with 26% of older Korean immigrants in the United States reporting abuse and 23% of older Koreans in Korea reporting abuse. However, there were significant differences in the types of emotional abuse experienced by older Koreans in both countries. Reports of some types of emotional abuse, such as 'name calling' and 'silent treatment,' were significantly higher in the United States than in Korea.

The economic activity and health of the elderly are very important factors with reference to the problems of the aged.

Subjects included 4226 elderly aged over 65 years among the adults who participated in the Fifth Korean National Longitudinal Study on Aging (KLoSA). Basic analysis, cross-analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and multiple regression analysis were performed to fulfill each research purpose. Male subjects were influenced more by the factors that affect the subjective health of the elderly than females were. Further, subjective health influenced economic activity more than socio-demographic characteristics and health behavior did. Specifically, among the male subjects, the health condition of salaried, self-employed, and unpaid family workers was better as compared to recipients of national health insurance and private health insurance, and unemployed subjects. Preparing for a super-aged society is a worldwide issue. The elderly represent a social participation class that should not be neglected. Therefore, it is necessary to support health promotion policies and increase institutional improvement by reflecting the level of economic activity of the elderly.","[Kim, Chae-Bong] Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Publ Hlth, 73 Inchon Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Yoon, Seok-Jun] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, 73 Inchon Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Ko, Jesuk] Gwangju Univ, Dept Healthcare Management, 277 Hyodeok Ro, Gwangju 61743, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Gwangju University,"Ko, J (corresponding author), Gwangju Univ, Dept Healthcare Management, 277 Hyodeok Ro, Gwangju 61743, South Korea.",bbp62@nate.com; yoonsj02@korea.ac.kr; jko@gwangju.ac.kr,"Ko, Jesuk/AAM-8616-2021","Ko, Jesuk/0000-0002-0577-8589; Yoon, Seok-Jun/0000-0003-3297-0071",Gwangju University,Gwangju University,"This study was conducted by research funds from Gwangju University in 2017.

Migration between North and South in a divided political system was a path by which the aims of the two newly founded nations and the choices of individual agents interlinked and crisscrossed. The refugees' reasons for migration were complicated and involved oppression by the socialist system in the North as well as familial and personal motivations. Furthermore, many were involuntarily evacuated due to military operations. After the war, resettlement projects were carried out in South Korea to incorporate refugees into society.

I construct four measures of provocations using a newly-assembled list of North Korean provocative events going back to 1960. The results show that the overall impact of North Korean provocations on South Korea's short-run economic growth is negligible. Since inter-Korean relations have gone through four phases, this paper also estimates the impact of provocations over each subperiod. Provocations had a significant impact on South Korea's economic growth during 1960-1970 and 1992-1997 when inter-Korean tensions were high, but the effects took on different signs. While provocations decreased South Korea's economic growth during 1992-1997, it had a positive impact on South Korea's macroeconomy before 1970. This paper provides evidence that the effect of national security threats may vary with the responses from the government and political factors such as the relation between the targeted country and the country that inflicts the threat.","[Qian, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Qian, W (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wqian0901@gmail.com,"Qian, Wei/AAZ-1543-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,2,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

In return for propaganda performances to convey images of material well-being of the regime and extolling the virtues of the ultimate leader, the autocratic regime bestows social recognition, legitimacy and fame to Moranbong members as a reward. Through an analysis of patron-client relationship in the North Korean political system, I move on to examine the ideological contents of Moranbong and the propaganda value-add they bring to the North Korean political system.

Korean participants (N = 210) were randomly presented with an experimental vignette consisting of a major apology component to examine their psychological responses, and they also ranked the importance of each major apology component (Study 2).

J,"Hong, SM",,,,"Hong, Seung Min",,,Exegetical Resistance: The Bible and Protestant Critical Insiders in South Korea,RELIGIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Korea; Protestantism; cultural studies,,"South Korean Protestantism has attracted scholars for a number of reasons including its almost unrivaled numeric growth and vibrancy in East Asia. Recent observations, however, have also noticed its negative perceptions among the general public in Korea, including those who profess to be Protestants. This study focuses on movements by Protestant critical insiders, namely, those who are committed to their Protestant faiths yet are highly critical of the ways in which the Protestant religion is taught, believed, and practiced in South Korea. Such emphasis on resistance fits well the scholarly agenda of cultural studies. The subjects of observation in this study, however, can take the cultural studies orthodoxy and flip it on its head. In cultural studies, it has been asserted that unintended-creative readings of culturaland religioustexts on the part of the readers indicate their resistive agency rather than subjugation. Korean Protestant critical insiders' various activities pertaining to the Bible, however, entail reversing such observations about interpreting cultural texts and empowerment. Instead of turning the signs upside down, as typically celebrated in cultural studies, what they aspire to do is follow more radically the intended meanings/readings of the text.

This study investigated the association between alcohol consumption and CVD incidence, and assessed whether this differed by reference group classification. As alcohol consumption amounts may change over time, the results of simple and time-dependent analyses were compared. Methods: Data were from a community-based cohort study on 40-to 69-year-old Koreans recruited in 2001 to 2002. A total of 8,330 participants were followed up for 10 years and classed as nondrinkers (0 g/d), drinker group 1 (< 15 g/d), and drinker group 2 (>= 15 g/d). The risk of CVD, including myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, was compared among groups using simple and time-dependent Cox analysis. Occasional drinkers (< 2.5 g/d), nondrinkers, and lifetime abstainers were used as comparison reference groups. Results: Simple Cox analysis indicated that drinker group 1 exhibited a significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR(: 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI(: 0.21, 0.92) and coronary artery disease (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.94) than nondrinkers. Time-dependent analysis based on alcohol consumption change showed that the beneficial effects of drinker group 1 were significant only for myocardial infarction, not for coronary artery disease. The benefits did not change significantly when either nondrinkers or lifetime abstainers were the reference group. However, when occasional drinkers were included in the reference group, the benefits of drinker group 1 were not significant for myocardial infarction (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.45) or coronary artery disease (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.19). Occasional drinkers and drinkers had more similar sociodemographic characteristics than did nondrinkers and drinkers. Conclusions: Further studies on alcohol consumption and its effects on health must use repeated measurement to define drinking status, as simple and time-dependent analyses can show different alcohol consumption risks. These findings do not indicate a beneficial effect of drinking < 15 g/d when occasional drinkers and nondrinkers are included in the reference group.","[Park, Ji-Eun; Cho, Sung-Il] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Park, Ji-Eun; Ryu, Yeonhee] Korea Inst Oriental Med, Daejeon, South Korea; [Cho, Sung-Il] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Hlth & Environm, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM); Seoul National University (SNU),"Cho, SI (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",scho@snu.ac.kr,"; Park, JIeun/KIL-1557-2024","Park, Ji-Eun/0000-0002-2932-5373;",KIOM Grant from Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine [K16070],KIOM Grant from Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine,This work was supported by a KIOM Grant (K16070) from Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine.,,46,11,11,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-6008,1530-0277,,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),FEB,2017,41,2,,,,,379,387,,10.1111/acer.13299,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acer.13299,,,9,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse,EK4IV,28098956,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000393891200017,View Full Record in Web of Science

We identified the adjusted influenza vaccination rates and assessed factors associated with influenza vaccination using multivariate logistic regression. Cancer survivors tended to have a higher adjusted influenza vaccination rate than the general population. The rates for influenza vaccination in specific cancer types such as stomach, hepatic, colon, and lung cancers were significantly higher than non-cancer survivors. Among all cancer survivors, those with chronic diseases, elderly subjects, and rural dwellers were more likely to receive influenza vaccination; those with cervical cancer were less likely to receive influenza vaccination. Cancer survivors were more likely to receive influenza vaccinations than non-cancer survivors, but this was not true for particular groups, especially younger cancer survivors. Cancer survivors represent a sharply growing population; therefore, immunization against influenza among cancer survivors should be concerned as their significant preventative healthcare services.","[Choi, Kyung-Hyun] Dongnam Inst Radiol & Med Sci, Ctr Hlth Promot & Canc Prevent, Pusan, South Korea; [Park, Sang Min] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Seoul 110744, South Korea; [Lee, Kiheon] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, JW LEE Ctr Global Med, Songnam, South Korea; [Lee, Kiheon] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Songnam, South Korea; [Lee, Kiheon] Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Songnam, South Korea; [Lee, Ju Hyun] Natl Police Hosp, Dept Family Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Joo-Sung] Dong A Univ, Dept Family Med, Coll Med, Pusan, South Korea",Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University Hospital; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Dong A University,"Park, SM (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 110744, South Korea.",smpark.snuh@gmail.com,"Park, Sang/V-9194-2019; Lee, Jungbin/JFA-8162-2023","LEE, JUHYUN/0000-0001-8623-0744; Park, Sang Min/0000-0002-7498-4829",,,,,39,22,22,0,9,KOREAN ACAD MEDICAL SCIENCES,SEOUL,"4F, 37 Ichon-ro 46-Gil, Yongsan-gu, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",1011-8934,1598-6357,,J KOREAN MED SCI,J.

Each wave of Korean migration was driven by different historical factors in the homeland and the host countries, and hence the motivations and characteristics of Korean immigrants in each period were different. The diverse conditions in and government policies of the host countries also affected the mode of entry and incorporation of Koreans. A contrast is drawn between the 'old' and the 'new' Korean migrations. The former consists of those who migrated to Russia, China, America and Japan from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century. They were from the lower classes, pushed out by poverty, war and oppression in the homeland. Few returned to the homeland but preserved their collective identities and ethnic cultures in their host societies. The new migrants to America, Europe and Latin America since the 1960s, however, come from middle-class backgrounds, are pulled by better opportunities in the host countries, travel freely between the homeland and host countries, and maintain transnational families and communities.

Using a descriptive design, patients with largely hematologic malignancies completed the questionnaires, including the Korean-Advance Directive (K-AD) model, which pertains to values, treatment wishes, and proxy appointment. Of 45 patients (aged 48.7 +/- 10.7 years, 51.1% men), two-thirds had leukemia (40.0%) and lymphoma (26.7%). Dying comfortably was the most frequently selected value (n = 20). Regarding treatment wishes, hospice care was the most desired type (n = 22), whereas aggressive treatments, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were less preferred (n = 3). The patient's spouse was most frequently appointed as a proxy (n = 27). Patients who completed all the 3 components of the K-AD model (51.1%) were less depressed (t = -2.31; P = .028) and more likely to perceive the benefits of the K-AD model (t = 2.07; P = .045), compared with the noncompleters (48.9%). Further, being male (odds ratio [OR], 6.42; P = .031), having higher scores on depressive symptoms (OR, 1.28; P = .016), and perceived barriers (OR, 1.08; P = .040) were associated with lower tendency to complete the K-AD model.

In the formal (political) dimension of citizenship, the article shows that Koreans fare comparatively poorly. They are less likely to be citizens than most other groups of immigrants, due to factors such as the lateness of Korean immigration. The article also analyzes the social dimension of citizenship among Koreans in Australia, and their disappointing socio-economic outcomes. Korean immigrants, I argue, enjoy residency without citizenship, and their experience illustrates how the promise of Australian citizenship has eroded.

However, older adults often report having missed doses, which they attribute to forgetfulness. The purpose of this study was to identify significant factors, including socioeconomic variables, hypertension history, and cognitive functions, contributing to medication adherence among older Korean adults with hypertension. Subjects and method: This study involved 241 older patients with hypertension from a community senior center during the period from 2008 to 2009. Data were collected through face to face interviews. The association of medication adherence with socioeconomic characteristics, hypertension-related history, knowledge, antihypertensive lifestyle, and memory was assessed by computing odds ratios in logistic regressions. Results and conclusions: Of the 241 patients, 44% were aged 75 or older, and 60% were male. The rate of non-adherence with antihypertensive medication was 41%. Metamemory, adherence to an antihypertensive lifestyle, and employment status, were associated with participants' adherence to antihypertensive medication in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Results suggest that memory functions are a key factor to medication adherence among the Korean elderly population. In contrast to younger adults, unintentional non-adherence appears to be a major issue for older adults to keep medicating. Interventions focusing on memory ability, such as strategies for recalling and placing cues, are needed for implementation in the population of older Korean patients with hypertension. Unemployed older people who have hypertensive lifestyles should also be considered a high-risk group for non-adherence to medication.","[Park, Yeon-Hwan; Koh, Chin Kang] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nursing, Res Inst Nursing Sci, Seoul 110799, South Korea; [Kim, Heejin] Seoul Natl Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Jang, Soong-Nang] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Med, Dept Nursing, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University Hospital,"Koh, CK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nursing, 28 Yeongun Dong, Seoul 110799, South Korea.",ckoh@snu.ac.kr,"; Jang, Soong-nang/AAC-1322-2020; Park, Yeon/AGK-4299-2022","Jang, Soong-nang/0000-0003-2621-945X; Park, Yeon-Hwan/0000-0002-5236-6683",,,,,50,37,43,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1474-5151,1873-1953,,EUR J CARDIOVASC NUR,Eur.

This study examined the factors affecting smoking cessation by age among Korean adult male smokers using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2018 (excluding 2013). Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate various factors associated with smoking cessation in three different age groups. Out of a total of 15,492 individuals, 31.5% of the 3523 individuals aged 19-39 years (young adult), 54.7% of the 7390 individuals aged 40-64 years (middle-aged), and 78.6% of the 4589 individuals aged >= 65 years (older adults) succeeded in quitting. In the young adult and middle-aged groups, being married was associated with successful quitting, and lifetime smoking was associated with unsuccessful quitting. Willpower and several comorbidities were related to successful cessation in the middle-aged and older adult groups. Skipping any meal, which suggests unhealthy behavior, was negatively related to quitting in the young adult group. We observed that factors associated with smoking cessation success or failure differed by age, which should be considered when developing smoking cessation policies and programs.","[Kim, Youngmee] Chung Ang Univ, Red Cross Coll Nursing, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Lee, Ji Sung; Cho, Won-Kyung] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Seoul 05505, South Korea; [Lee, Ji Sung] Asan Med Ctr, Clin Res Ctr, Asan Inst Life Sci, Seoul 05505, South Korea; [Cho, Won-Kyung] Asan Med Ctr, Int Healthcare Ctr, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Seoul 05505, South Korea",Chung Ang University; University of Ulsan; University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center; University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center,"Cho, WK (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Seoul 05505, South Korea.;Cho, WK (corresponding author), Asan Med Ctr, Int Healthcare Ctr, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",youngkim234@gmail.com; totoro96a@gmail.com; wonkyungcho@hotmail.com,,"Kim, Youngmee/0000-0002-0206-7300; Cho, Won-Kyung/0000-0003-1540-545X; Lee, Ji Sung/0000-0001-8194-3462",,,,,45,14,14,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This paper investigates the role of loudness and pitch in determining the perception of politeness-related judgments in Korean. It has been proposed that high pitch is universally associated with polite or deferential social meanings. In contrast to this, Experiment 1 examined the perceptual effect of pitch and found no effect. Experiment 2 tested the effect of loudness, and found that listeners associate quieter speech with deference. Finally, Experiment 3 investigated the simultaneous effects of loudness and pitch, and found again that loudness had a consistent effect, whereas pitch only had a weak effect. Analyses of individual differences suggest that in contrast to loudness, which is interpreted uniformly across Korean listeners, pitch has more variegated social meanings: Some listeners associate high pitch with deferential meaning, others associate low pitch with deferential meaning. Thus, we find loudness to be a more unambiguous indicator of deferential speech than pitch. These findings shed light on how different acoustic properties contribute to the indexing of social stances, and they suggest that the role of pitch in conveying politeness may have been overstated in past research.","[Idemaru, Kaori] Univ Oregon, 308 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Winter, Bodo] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Brown, Lucien] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Oh, Grace Eunhae] Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Oregon; University of Birmingham; Monash University; Konkuk University,"Idemaru, K (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, 308 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",idemaru@uoregon.edu,"Winter, Bodo/K-6975-2018","Winter, Bodo/0000-0001-6036-6774",,,,,87,25,25,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0023-8309,1756-6053,,LANG SPEECH,Lang.

In the traditional naming pattern, Korean first names consist of a generation marker and a unique portion, and the order between these two elements alternates between generations. To derive vocative forms, the generation marker is truncated, and the suffixal [(j) a] is attached to the unique portion. We argue that MOP naturally predicts this type of truncation. As the generation marker is shared by all the members of the same generation, the generation marker is highly predictable and hence does not reduce uncertainty about the intended message. To achieve effective communication, predictable portions are deleted. Our analysis implies that MOP is relevant not only to phonetic implementation patterns, but also to morphophonological patterns. It also provides support for MOP based on data from a non-Indo-European language. Finally, we aim to integrate insights of MOP with a more formal proposal like Optimality Theory, by relating the predictability of a contrast to the ranking of the faithfulness constraint that it protects, following the spirit of the P-map hypothesis.","[Kawahara, Shigeto] Keio Univ, Inst Cultural & Linguist Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Lee, Seunghun J.] Int Christian Univ, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan; [Lee, Seunghun J.] Univ Venda, Thohoyandou, South Africa",Keio University; International Christian University; University of Venda,"Kawahara, S (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Inst Cultural & Linguist Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",kawahara@icl.keio.ac.jp,,,"JSPS [10.13039/501100001691, 15F15715, 26284059, 17K13448]; Laboratory Program for Korean Studies [AKS-2016-LAB-225004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15F15715, 26284059] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Laboratory Program for Korean Studies; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Thanks to the participants at the Japanese/Korean Linguistics 24 and at the predictability symposium at Sydney, especially Jason Shaw, without whom this work would not exist.

The present study examines how Korean speakers choose between alternative syntactic structures. Following the methodology of Ferreira, we conducted a series of production studies investigating the effects of syntactic flexibility in Korean numeral quantifier constructions and active/passive constructions. Two models of sentence production make different predictions regarding the effects of syntactic flexibility. The competitive model predicts that syntactic flexibility should cause production difficulties (e.g. longer production latencies and more errors) because alternative structures compete for selection, restricting one another's availability. In contrast, according to the incremental model, syntactic flexibility should facilitate production (e.g. shorter production latencies and fewer errors) because it allows more accessible lexical items to be accommodated sooner. Ferreira's results support the incremental model in English. Our results, however, show that Korean speakers produced utterances more slowly in the flexible condition, which provides support for the competitive model. We suggest that the different findings in English and Korean are related to how they assign grammatical functions.","[Hwang, Heeju; Kaiser, Elsi] Univ So Calif, Dept Linguist, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Hwang, Heeju] Stanford Univ, Dept Linguist, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Southern California; Stanford University,"Hwang, H (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Dept Linguist, 3601 Watt Way Grace Ford Salvatori 301, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",heeju.hwang@gmail.com,"; Kaiser, Elsi/N-8328-2019","Hwang, Heeju/0000-0003-3444-9423;",,,,,61,18,20,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2327-3798,2327-3801,,LANG COGN NEUROSCI,Lang.

J,"Hatfield, H; Hahn, JW",,,,"Hatfield, Hunter; Hahn, Jee-Won",,,What Korean apologies require of politeness theory,JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sociolinguistics; Face; Korean; Politeness; Apologies,FACE; JAPANESE,"This paper examines a corpus of Korean apologies to discover why a person apologizes and why they choose the form of apology that they do. It argues for an abstracted, generalized politeness1 model (Locher and Watts, 2005; Watts, 2003) in which politeness work in Korean is primarily concerned with relationship construction (Arundale, 2006; Haugh, 2007c; Matsumoto, 1988). This will involve both a notion of face, conceived as a psychological, acquired construct, and a set of frames (Terkourafi, 2005) that do not directly reference face. To arrive at this theoretical point, the paper begins by examining the social factors that influence choices in apology forms as predicted by Brown and Levinson (1987). Brown and Levinson's model accurately predicts the relevance of many factors in form selection in Korean, such as relative power, social distance, and the severity of the act. However, the model itself is not an accurate model for Korean even in high abstraction. Instead of choosing a strategy based upon the weight of a face-threatening act, Koreans actively manage and create expectations for behavior in a relationship. Some expectations will resemble classic positive and negative face issues, while others will more directly reference culture-specific roles or common events. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

What effect might such operations have had on the course of the war and subsequent American thinking on limited war? It concludes that the US missed a critical opportunity to conclude the war on more favorable terms; that the American decision to forgo amphibious operations in June 1951 had less to do with military calculations than with the domestic political firestorm that followed MacArthur's relief; and that the 'lost chance' not only increased the cost and duration of the Korean War, but encouraged subsequent decision makers to overstate the risks of intra-war escalation and understate the risks of premature, de-escalation.","USN, War Coll, Newport, RI USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy,"Jackson, CF (corresponding author), USN, War Coll, Newport, RI USA.",,,,,,,,33,5,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0140-2390,,,J STRATEGIC STUD,J.

Predisposing characteristics (age, sex, and education), health needs (chronic conditions, functional disability, and number of sick days), and a variety of enabling factors (health insurance, English speaking ability, transportation, living arrangement, trust in Western medicine, and reported experience of disrespect in medical settings) were considered. After controlling for predisposing and need factors, health insurance coverage was found to be a significant enabling factor for hospital visits. Subjective perception of health was found to be significant not only for healthcare utilization, but also for satisfaction with service. A greater likelihood of satisfaction was also observed in individuals with health insurance, better English-speaking ability, and greater trust in Western medical care. The reported experience of disrespect or discrimination in medical settings significantly reduced the odds of satisfaction with service.","Univ S Florida, Dept Aging & Mental Hlth, Florida Mental Hlth Inst, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; Univ S Florida, Sch Aging Studies, Tampa, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Jang, Y (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Aging & Mental Hlth, Florida Mental Hlth Inst, 13301 Bruce B Downs Blvd, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",yjang@fmhi.usf.edu,,,,,,,24,78,112,1,17,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0002-8614,,,J AM GERIATR SOC,J.

The first two experiments, which compared the canonical SOV pattern with the non-canonical OSV pattern, employed picture-selection comprehension tasks to assess knowledge of case. Poor performance on OSV sentences was mitigated by experimental manipulations that either enhanced the perceptual salience of case or provided felicitous conditions for the use of non-canonical word order. The next three experiments, all involving production tasks, revealed that many children who failed to demonstrate knowledge of case in the comprehension tasks actually produced nominative and accusative case correctly, thereby revealing their knowledge of this morphosyntactic system.","[Kim, Kitaek] Gyeongin Natl Univ Educ, Dept English Language Educ, Sammak Ro 155, Anyang Si 13910, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [O'Grady, William; Schwartz, Bonnie D.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kim, K (corresponding author), Gyeongin Natl Univ Educ, Dept English Language Educ, Sammak Ro 155, Anyang Si 13910, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",kitaek@ginue.ac.kr; ogrady@hawaii.edu; bds@hawaii.edu,"; Kim, Kitaek/AAU-7173-2021","Kim, Kitaek/0000-0002-1242-034X;",,,,,48,28,28,0,1,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1879-9264,1879-9272,,LINGUIST APPROACH BI,Linguist.

Community health practitioners in Korea are recognised as a critical component of the public health workforce in rural areas. Community health practitioners are registered nurses with six months special training, who have the chief responsibility of delivering primary health care to remote or isolated communities. Although there has been numerous changes in focus of community health practitioners practice over the two decades, community health practitioners guidelines have never been updated since being first developed in 1981. This investigation employed a cross-sectional survey and focus group interview. The samples included two different groups: 1003 community health practitioners participated in a survey and a group of 12 community health practitioners participated in a focus group interview. A measure of perception of the guideline was developed from Mansfield's work. Goolsby's criteria were revised and used to guide the focus group interview. The participants recognised that the role of community health practitioners is in a process of transition and expect to use well developed guidelines that will allow an appropriate response to the needs of the community. Community health practitioners are generally supportive of practice guidelines although they report various contextual, social and resource barriers to the use of practice guidelines. Finally, the researchers have provided recommendations for the development of new community health practitioners practice guidelines. A newly developed community health practitioners guideline should assist in articulating new roles and responsibilities in the practice of community health practitioners and establish a foundation for knowledge, skills and training necessary for them to work independently. New services made available for under-recognised health problems may be a direct outcome of newly developed guidelines.","[Lee, Tae Wha] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Dept Nursing Environm & Syst, Res Policy Inst, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, In Sook] Cheju Halla Coll, Dept Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Ko, Il Sun] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Dept Clin Nursing Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Lee, TW (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Dept Nursing Environm & Syst, Res Policy Inst, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",twlee5@yuhs.ac,,"Ko, Il Sun/0000-0003-3671-4833; Lee, Tae Wha/0000-0003-2568-3074",Research Committee of the Korean Community Health Practitioners Association (KCHPA); CHPs; Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare Research Fund [02-PJ1-PG5-P15-0001],Research Committee of the Korean Community Health Practitioners Association (KCHPA); CHPs; Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare Research Fund,We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Research Committee of the Korean Community Health Practitioners Association (KCHPA) and the CHPs who were willing to participate and their experiences.

While creating new human rights through court decisions have been criticised by those concerned about 'rights inflation' for devaluing the currency of human rights, this article argues that it is a natural process evolved along various aspects of a constantly changing society and increasing social demands. Moreover, the author argues that it is a desirable process in a democratic society because it enables us to empower many citizens, including the previously marginalised, to seek a less discriminatory society by distributing authority to speak out about unfairness and injustice. Introducing some empirical cases where the judicial decision considered constant changes in social situation and reflected on them in overturning precedents, the author stresses the need to look at the background and social circumstances wherein new rights emerged from a social and cultural perspective of law to better understand the human rights discourse, as well as elevate the level of human rights protection.","[Joo, Haeri] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Joo, H (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hrjoo1030@gmail.com,"JOO, Haeri/AAK-6658-2021","JOO, Haeri/0000-0001-7595-4237",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-2987,1744-053X,,INT J HUM RIGHTS,Int.

The balance of forces favors a more politicized, more expensive, and more internationally contested Korean unification course than in Germany. Domestically: there are more North Koreans than there were East Germans, and they are much poorer. There are fewer South Koreans than there were West Germans, and they are less wealthy also. South Korea's state strength or capacity is lower than West Germany's was, while North Korea is a semi-failed state, even by East German standards. So, fewer people with a lower GDP per capita in a weaker system will support more people with less wealth from a worse system. Internationally: today's external patron (the United States) of the free Korean half is weakening, while the external patron (China) of the communist half is strengthening. The opposite was true of the United States and West Germany, and the Soviet Union and East Germany, in 1989. Today's northern patron (China) is trying to push further into the Asian continent, while yesterday's eastern patron (the Soviet Union) was looking for an exit from central Europe. Chinese peninsular intervention is therefore easier, while U.S. support for South Korea's unification terms will be more difficult.","Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Pusan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Kelly, R (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Pusan, South Korea.",robertkelly260@hotmail.com,,,,,,,94,5,6,0,25,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (K-CAINS). Inpatients (n = 49) and outpatients (n = 70) with schizophrenia were recruited from three institutions. The confirmative factor analysis, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were assessed. The study group consisted of 71 males (59.7%) and 48 females (40.3%). Their mean age was 42.15 years (SD = 12.2). The K-CAINS was confirmed to be divided into two subscales of 9 items related to motivation/pleasure and 4 items related to expression in concordance with the original version of the CAINS. The results showed that the K-CAINS had a good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84-0.94), test-retest reliability (r = 0.90, P < 0.001). Convergent validity was proven by demonstrating a significant correlation with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Discriminant validity was proven by the lack of a significant correlation with the PANSS positive subscale, the Korean version of the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Korean version of the Calgary depression scale for schizophrenia (K-CDSS), and the Modified Simpson Angus scale (MSAS). The K-CAINS could be a reliable and valid tool to assess the negative symptoms of Korean schizophrenia patients.","[Jung, Sung Il; Woo, Jungmin] Catholic Univ Daegu, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 33 Duryugongwon Ro 17 Gil, Taegu 42472, South Korea; [Kim, Yang-Tae] Keimyung Univ, Dongsan Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Taegu, South Korea; [Kwak, Sang Gyu] Catholic Univ Daegu, Sch Med, Dept Med Stat, Taegu 42472, South Korea",Catholic University of Daegu; Keimyung University; Catholic University of Daegu,"Woo, J (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Daegu, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 33 Duryugongwon Ro 17 Gil, Taegu 42472, South Korea.",woojm3@daum.net,"Kwak, Sang Gyu/AAG-4341-2021","Kwak, Sanggyu/0000-0003-0398-5514; Woo, Jungmin/0000-0001-7180-9972",,,,,35,21,21,0,6,KOREAN ACAD MEDICAL SCIENCES,SEOUL,"4F, 37 Ichon-ro 46-Gil, Yongsan-gu, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",1011-8934,1598-6357,,J KOREAN MED SCI,J.

Mainstream innovation theories make disparate claims for how (1) intensity of innovation, (2) scope of innovation and (3) spillovers impact firm performance. Using a comparative institutionalist approach we hypothesise how these relationships apply to firms in Korea and China. Analysis of 897 firmyear data points over a 4-year period provides broad support for our hypotheses. Intensity of innovation (patent intensity) is a strong cross-contextual argument. Scope and spillover arguments appear to be more context-sensitive. Firms with innovation depth in specific technological fields enjoy better performance in Korea, while diversified innovation is more beneficial for firms in China. Spillovers have a stronger impact in Korea than China. The findings underline the importance of incorporating change in institutional context when developing policy and theory relating to firm innovation and performance in emerging economies.","[Choi, Suk Bong] Univ Ulsan, Sch Business Adm, Dept Management, Ulsan 680749, South Korea; [Williams, Christopher] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON, Canada",University of Ulsan; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University Western Ontario Hospital,"Williams, C (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON, Canada.",cwilliams@ivey.uwo.ca,,,,,,,127,14,15,1,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7325,1465-3990,,TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG,Technol.

This paper examines the case of Korea where economic growth, education equality (as measured by years of schooling), and educational quality have all been on the rise for many decades. Using time series data on schooling for adults of 25-85 years, a measure of education equality is calculated. Education equality is shown to be increasing through the years. A Cobb-Douglas production function for the economy was estimated using both years of schooling and education equality measures. When both measures are included, education equality is a strong predictor of economic growth.","Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Ilon, L (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",lynnilon@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,63,2,2,2,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1598-1037,1876-407X,,ASIA PAC EDUC REV,Asia Pac.

In this study, we evaluated whether the interaction of frailty and nutritional deficiency is additive and/or multiplicative. Methods: We analyzed data from 8907 individuals (>= 65 years old) who took part in the 2008 Survey on Health and Welfare Status of the Elderly in Korea. We used the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty index and the DETERMINE checklist for assessment of frailty and nutritional status, respectively. We conducted Cox regression analysis for the outcomes 'mortality' and 'mortality and long-term hospitalization risk.' Results: In the multivariate analysis for main effect model on 'mortality', the hazard ratios (HRs) of frail, high nutritional risk were 2.63 (95% CI 1.76-3.93), 1.04 (95% CI 0.78-1.38), respectively, and on 'mortality and long-term hospitalization risk' those values were 2.56 (95% CI 1.72-3.80), 1.18 (95% CI 0.88-1.58), respectively. In interaction effect model, multiplicative interaction existed between frailty and nutritional status (p < 0.001). Participants with frail X high nutritional risk had much higher HRs for 'mortality' (4.14, 95% CI 2.43-7.07) and 'mortality and long-term hospitalization risk' (4.60, 95% CI 2.74-7.72). Conclusion: We found that frailty and nutritional status have a multiplicative effect on adverse outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Nutritional status assessment in older people is important because nutritional supplementation can potentially improve both nutritional status and frailty.","[Choe, Yu-Ri; Joh, Ju-Youn; Kim, Yeon-Pyo] Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Dept Family Med, Hwasun, South Korea; [Sunwoo, Duk] Korea Inst Hlth & Social Affairs, Sejong, South Korea; [Kim, Yeon-Pyo] Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Gwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs; Chonnam National University,"Kim, YP (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Dept Family Med, 322 Seoyang Ro, Hwasun Gun, Chonnam, South Korea.;Kim, YP (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, 160 Baekseo Ro, Gwangju, South Korea.",hiyuriya@naver.com; hoya419@hanmail.net; duksw@kihasa.re.kr; ypkim@jnu.ac.kr,,,Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital Institute for Biomedical Science [HCRI 17 919-1],Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital Institute for Biomedical Science,This study was supported by a grant (HCRI 17 919-1) Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital Institute for Biomedical Science.,,31,4,4,0,15,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0167-4943,1872-6976,,ARCH GERONTOL GERIAT,Arch.

Although extensive work has been carried out to clarify its causes and relevant phonological processes, this tensification is deemed not entirely predictable. This paper presents a speech production experiment that confirms the existing findings that the variability in tensification is predictable to a certain extent. The experimental results also showed that the relationship between the predictors and the variability is not linear and that tensification mirrors the cognitively determined boundary strength. Native Korean speakers calibrate the boundary strength by incorporating complex information, such as the word's length, segment type, frequency, and plausibility of the compound. While a tight boundary led to high tensification probability, it was not affected by speaking-rate variation. Furthermore, the perceived compound's plausibility directly affected the duration of the tensified consonant. Importantly, the findings suggest that speakers' calibration of the boundary strength is fluid and changeable over time and it affects both phonological and phonetic outputs. Finally, variability in data was reduced for the experimental conditions leading to either extremely high or low tensification probability, and there seemed to be lexicalized exceptions to the general trends.","[Jeon, Hae-Sung] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Humanities Language & Global Studies, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Jeon, HS (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Humanities Language & Global Studies, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",HJeon1@uclan.ac.uk,,,Academy of Korean Studies Grant [AKS-2017-R18],Academy of Korean Studies Grant,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by an Academy of Korean Studies Grant (No. AKS-2017-R18).",,96,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0023-8309,1756-6053,,LANG SPEECH,Lang.

Guided by Andersen's behavioral health model, the study considered predisposing factors (age, sex, marital status, education), potential health needs (chronic conditions, functional disability), and enabling factors (health insurance, acculturation, prior awareness of hospice). Nearly three-quarters of the sample answered yes to the following statement and question, Hospice is a program that helps people who are dying by making them feel comfortable and free of pain when they can no longer be cured of their disease. If you needed hospice services, would you use them? A greater willingness was observed in younger persons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-0.98) and those with higher levels of education (OR = 1.67,95% CI = 1.12-2.48), more chronic conditions (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.05-1.44), health insurance (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.94), higher levels of acculturation (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10), and prior awareness of hospice (OR = 4.43, 95% CI = 2.85-6.90). The present study highlights the role of prior awareness in shaping individuals' attitudes toward services, calling attention to a need for community education and outreach programs for racial and ethnic minorities, with specific emphasis on dissemination of information and greater awareness of hospice services.

The present study aimed to determine effective dose of oxytocin spray on emotion recognition in healthy Korean males. Methods The study followed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Thirty-seven Korean males underwent two experimental sessions, with one week in between. They received either 32 (n=19) or 40 (n=18) international units (IU) of oxytocin and placebo, and then completed a face emotion recognition task. The effect of oxytocin on emotion recognition was examined using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each dose condition. Results The higher dose (40 IU) was found to improve recognition of happy faces, while the lower dose (32 IU) had no effect. There were no statistical differences in age, education, attachment style or empathic ability between the two dose groups. Conclusion The results suggest that oxytocin increases the ability of Korean males to recognize positive emotion, and this effect is dose-dependent. Additional studies evaluating the effect of higher doses of oxytocin on social cognition will help to determine the optimal dose for Korean populations.","[Shin, Na Young] Kyonggi Univ, Coll Liberal Arts & Interdisciplinary Studies, Suwon, South Korea; [Park, Hye Yoon; Kwon, Jun Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Wi Hoon] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Jun Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Kyonggi University; Seoul National University (SNU); Korea University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Kwon, JS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.;Kwon, JS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.",kwonjs@snu.ac.kr,"Jung, Wi/J-4033-2019",,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2016R1E1A1A02921618]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This study has funded by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (2016R1E1A1A02921618).",,52,11,12,0,6,KOREAN NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ASSOC,SEOUL,"RN 522, G-FIVE CENTRAL PLAZA 1685-8 SEOCHO 4-DONG, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL, 137-882, SOUTH KOREA",,1976-3026,,PSYCHIAT INVEST,Psychiatry Investig.,JUL,2018,15,7,,,,,710,716,,10.30773/pi.2018.02.19,http://dx.doi.org/10.30773/pi.2018.02.19,,,7,Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychiatry,GN4GE,29898580,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000438975400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Community-residing 285 KAs living in New York City and Teaneck, New Jersey completed questionnaires measuring traumatic life experiences, depressive symptoms, and resilience. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, and two-step hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. 54% of KAs with traumatic life experiences reported at least mild depressive symptoms; greater resilience was associated with fewer such symptoms. English proficiency, length of time in US, marital status, and employment were significant predictors for depressive symptoms in the first step of multiple regression, but when resilience was introduced in the second step, it was the only significant predictor of depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that resilience should be supported to promote positive mental health outcomes for traumatized KAs who are depressed, and that resilience-focused interventions for this population should be designed.","[Bernstein, Kunsook; Nokes, Kathleen M.] CUNY, Hunter Coll, 425 East 25th St, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Park, So-Young] NYU, Silver Sch Social Work, 1 Washington Sq North, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nokes, Kathleen M.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, 425 East 25th St, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); New York University; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Bernstein, K (corresponding author), CUNY, Hunter Coll, 425 East 25th St, New York, NY 10010 USA.",kbernst@hunter.cuny.edu,"Nokes, Kathleen M/GXM-8494-2022","bernstein, kunsook/0000-0003-4029-4157; Park, So-Young/0000-0002-4573-6826",Research Foundation of TheCity University of NewYork [67545-00-45],Research Foundation of TheCity University of NewYork,The funding was provided by Research Foundation of TheCity University of NewYork (67545-00-45).,,55,13,17,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0010-3853,1573-2789,,COMMUNITY MENT HLT J,Community Ment.

ADHD is familial and genetic studies estimate heritability at 80-90%. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the genetic type and alleles for gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit beta-3 (GABA3) gene in Korean children with ADHD. Methods The sample consisted of 180 ADHD children and 159 control children. We diagnosed ADHD according to DSM-W ADHD symptoms were evaluated with Conners' Parent Rating Scales and Dupaul Parent ADHD Rating Scales. Blood samples were taken from the 339 subjects, DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes, and PCR was performed for GABA3 rs2081648, rs1426217 and rs981778 Polymorphism. Alleles and genotype frequencies were compared using the chi-square test. We compared the allele and genotype frequencies of GABA3 gene polymorphism in the ADHD and control groups. Results This study showed that there was a significant correlation among the frequencies of the rs2081648 (OR-=0.71,95% CI=0.51-0.98, p=0.040) of alleles of MAO, but the final conclusions are not definite. Follow up studies with larger patient or pure subgroups are expected.

The involvement level of Korean Wave visitors was found to operate as a mechanism by which challenge, skills, and focused attention on site might be more organized or more actively experienced. This recognizes that there is clearly a need for making the FIT sites exposed much by any mix of various media. The findings of this study showed that challenges and skills influence enjoyment as an output factor of flow. Film site visitors are assumed to participate in the roles of film characters, experiencing the places and the atmosphere. The degree of visitors' reflections of the film optimizes awareness of flow experiences on the site. Therefore it is necessary to provide more detailed experiential programs on the film sites with a wide variety of flow-related contents in the film.","[Lee, Tae Hee] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Seoul 130071, South Korea; [Yoo, Jae Kyung] Kyunggi Tourism Corp, Kyunggido, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Lee, TH (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Hoi Gi Dong 1, Seoul 130071, South Korea.",taehee@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,19,19,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1054-8408,1540-7306,,J TRAVEL TOUR MARK,J.

Design: Data were drawn from a population-based probability sample using a telephone survey conducted by bilingual, professional interviewers (N = 2085). About 85.0% of eligible respondents completed interviews and 86.3% of participants preferred to be interviewed in Korean. Main Outcome Measure: Smoking status was measured using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, ever smoked 100 cigarettes and currently smoke every day or some days. Results and Conclusion: Reports of immediate criticism by others in several settings was associated with nonsmoking, but likelihood of immediate legal penalties was unrelated. Participants were far less likely to expect legal than social sanction. Results were replicated after controlling for reinforcers of smoking and ecologically relevant variables including models of smoking, primary group social support for smoking, acculturation, sex, acculturation by sex (male) interaction, age, and education. It may be efficacious to target public health interventions encouraging appropriate social sanctions of smoking in public among persons of Korean descent, and to encourage strict enforcement of legal penalties for smoking in public places.","[Hofstetter, C.

Using a food-frequency questionnaire and a modified Suinn-Lew Asian self-identity acculturation scale, differences in the frequencies of food items, food groups and nutrient intakes consumed were analysed by level of acculturation. The low-acculturated group tended to consume significantly more rice, mixed rice, soyabean paste chigae (pot stew), saengsun (fish) chigae, kimchi chigae, other fish broiled or baked, eggs, kimchi, spinach, persimmons, and white or brown sugar in coffee or tea. The high-acculturated group demonstrated a statistically greater tendency to consume bread, cereal, spaghetti, ham, green salad, sweetcom, chocolate, candies and diet soft drinks. The more acculturated an individual, the more significant was the tendency to consume sweets. The more acculturated group had significantly (P<0.05) higher intakes of % energy from total fat, thiamin, vitamin E and folate, while the low-acculturated group consumed greater amounts of Na, niacin and dietary fibre.

In contrast to the Koreans, who indicated the treaties were concluded under duress, the Japanese focused on seeking international approval. By analysing the German news reports on the Japanese annexation of Korea published between 1905 and 1945, this article examines whether Germans believed the Japanese colonisation of Korea conformed to international law and custom. This article demonstrates two main findings. First, the Japanese government attempted to produce international approval by directly intervening in the production of news articles. The Japanese government made particular newspapers and journalists act as their agents and almost completely suppressed reports on events such as the signing of the annexation treaty of 1910. Despite these efforts, the flourishing world of German journalism was too diverse to accept Japanese intervention passively. This article also shows that the international community did not perceive the annexation treaties as of legal. The annexation treaties were interpreted simply as the continued process of colonisation and only pro-Japanese newspapers showed interest in the legality of the annexation treaties. Considering these realities of the German media landscape, we should be careful in discussing the international approval of the annexation treaties as a fact.","[Soohyun, Mun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Soohyun, M (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Hist, Seoul, South Korea.",munshyun@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,63,0,0,0,3,ACADEMIA KOREANA KEIMYUNG UNIV,DAEGU,"1095 DALGUBEOLDAERO, DALSEO-GU, DAEGU, 704-701, SOUTH KOREA",1520-7412,,,ACTA KOREANA,Acta Koreana,DEC,2019,22,2,,,,,305,323,,10.18399/acta.2019.22.2.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2019.22.2.006,,,19,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,NS7HT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:000572429100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the rise and fall of North Korea's relations with China were determined by the political division on the Korean peninsula and Sino-Soviet polemics, and in the competition for influence between ideological and security concerns, the latter won out.

The research underscores the importance of considering both individual and environmental factors in studies of language learning. It proposes that the Korean communicative intentions of Chinese undergraduate students arise from the complex interaction of individual internal factors (emotional intelligence, anxiety) and external factors (the Korean classroom social environment). The study found that emotional intelligence and the classroom social environment significantly influence students' Korean communicative intention, primarily through reducing communication anxiety. This underscores the complex relationship between individual attributes and environmental factors, as they jointly shape psychological dynamics that influence academic performance. The study also revealed that once a certain threshold is met in the classroom social environment, the influence of emotional intelligence on communication anxiety becomes prominent. This finding highlights the importance of creating a conducive classroom social environment to enhance students' emotional intelligence and reduce their communication anxiety, thereby promoting their Korean communicative intention.

As the largest United States military outpost in Asia for most of the twentieth century, Clark SEZ is now controlled by the Philippine central government under the Office of the President which brokers the lease of land to foreign investors, including South Korean entities. Following Hannah Arendt who defines imperialism as international business interests disguised as national interests, we understand Korean imperialism in the area as capitalist investments that take nationalist forms. Korean golf-defined as Korean people, culture, and property related to the sport of golf-reterritorializes the South Korean nation onto Clark and operates within historically produced inequalities of the area characterized by environmental, class, gender, racial, and economic asymmetries. Korean golf plays a central role in bringing Korean people to Clark and anchoring Korean investment in manufacturing, hospitality industries, and real estate. Exclusive developments like Korean golf courses function to deny the claims to land made by indigenous peoples and small-scale farmers who assert their ancestral rights to these lands and their rights to farm for their survival. This study weaves together the subjective pleasures of Korean golf with the critical stakes for those who are erased from the landscapes they call home.","[Joo, Rachael M.] Middlebury Coll, Amer Studies, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Medriano, Jose S.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Medriano, Jose S.] Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Psychol, Quezon City, Philippines",Middlebury College; University of Oxford; Ateneo de Manila University,"Joo, RM (corresponding author), Middlebury Coll, Amer Studies, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",rjoo@middlebury.edu,,"Medriano, Jose III/0000-0002-7303-5293",,,,,84,1,1,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

Numerous strategic changes are anticipated in Northeast Asia over the coming years, including the risk of a military attack by North Korea and a shift in the balance of power. Among multiple factors that contribute to the success of an alliance, one key factor is sharing a common vision of the future since sharing this is crucial to enhance the trust shared today and to reinforce the alliance's capability to respond effectively to any new challenges that may arise. This paper seeks to offer a vision for the ROK-U.S. alliance and make suggestions on how the alliance can develop and improve in the future by trying to forecast changes in the security circumstances surrounding the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia until around 2030. As a result, this paper finds the fact that maintaining the ROK-U.S. alliance is the optimal choice for both countries until 2030, despite the various strategic changes in Northeast Asia, including a possible national reunification of the Korean Peninsula and presents a long-term vision for the ROK-U.S. alliance based on this fact and some implementation strategies for this vision.","[Hyo, Seol In; Changsu, Kim] Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea",,"Hyo, SI (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea.",sulinhyo@naver.com; cskimida@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,8,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

It argues that the unprecedented progress in North Korea's nuclear program, along with a constant U.S. persuasion, led to a certain political convergence to allow and accompany the security cooperation. This said, political mistrust, asymmetric expectations and diverging perspectives still persist, explaining why the cooperation is mainly taking place within the trilateral framework. Nevertheless, the latest set of dialogue, exchanges and joint exercises did build up confidence and highlighted the benefit of an expanded cooperation while pushing the two countries to seriously consider the concrete issues, conditions and implications of such cooperation. The paper concludes that the recent progress in the security cooperation is still fragile and dependent on external factors, even if it is pointing to a greater understanding.","[Pajon, Celine; Hemez, Remy] French Inst Int Relat, Paris, France",,"Pajon, C (corresponding author), French Inst Int Relat, Paris, France.",pajon@ifri.org; rhemez@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,8,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

This cross-sectional study aimed to understand the factors affecting the usage and satisfaction of Korean medicine (KM) in subfertile women. An online survey was conducted from 3 November to 8 November 2021. The survey collected basic information, KM treatment experience, and satisfaction from women who experienced poor pregnancy. The t-test and chi-square test (chi 2-test) were used to determine the overall characteristics of the subjects and factors affecting the utilization and satisfaction of KM treatment. Of the total of 29,465 people, 4922 read the survey email, and 601 responded. After excluding 51 respondents with questionable response patterns, 550 respondents were included in the final analysis. Of these, 43.1% (n = 237) had experience with conventional treatment, and 16.5% (n = 91) had received KM treatment. The group that received both KM treatment and CM treatment (n = 59, 24.9%) was significantly more prevalent than the group that received KM treatment alone (n = 32, 10.2%) (p = 0.00). Women who had given birth more than once or held a master's degree were significantly more willing to participate in the 'KM Support Project for Subfertility' program. Our findings suggest that subfertile patients prefer integrated treatment that combines KM and CM treatments. Further studies are needed to assess the status of integrative medicine treatment, satisfaction with each KM intervention, factors for low satisfaction, and patient requirements.","[Park, Minjung] Seoul Digital Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Adm, Seoul 07654, South Korea; [Shin, Seungwon] Sangji Univ, Coll Korean Med, Wonju 26339, South Korea; [Kim, Jihye] Assoc Korean Med, Res Inst Korean Med Policy, Seoul 07525, South Korea; [Kim, Jong-hyun] Gachon Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Med Class & Hist, Seongnam 13306, South Korea; [Kim, Dong-Il] Dongguk Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Gyeongju 38066, South Korea; [Sung, Soo-Hyun] Natl Inst Korean Med Dev, Dept Policy Dev, Seoul 04561, South Korea; [Park, Jang-Kyung] Pusan Natl Univ, Korean Med Hosp, Dept Korean Med Obstet & Gynecol, Yangsan 50612, South Korea",Sangji University; Gachon University; Dongguk University; Pusan National University,"Sung, SH (corresponding author), Natl Inst Korean Med Dev, Dept Policy Dev, Seoul 04561, South Korea.;Park, JK (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Korean Med Hosp, Dept Korean Med Obstet & Gynecol, Yangsan 50612, South Korea.",ssw.kmd@gmail.com; koyote10010@nikom.or.kr; vivat314@pusan.ac.kr,"; Shin, Seungwon/Q-4320-2016; Soo-Hyun, Sung/ADL-0758-2022; Park, Minjung/HJZ-5206-2023","Park, Minjung/0000-0003-2219-9666; Shin, Seungwon/0000-0002-6160-0339; Soo-Hyun, Sung/0000-0001-7606-0147; Park, Jang Kyung/0000-0002-4323-278X;","Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [RS-2021-KH110950]; Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea","Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Health & Welfare (MOHW), Republic of Korea); Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea","This study was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: RS-2021-KH110950).

Unlike English, Mandarin and Korean allow long-distance (LD) reflexives. While himself/herself and the Mandarin equivalent taziji both require local readings, Mandarin ziji 'self' allows both local and LD readings. In Korean, caki and casin allow LD readings while caki-casin requires local readings. For pronouns, English him/her and Mandarin ta both disallow local readings while Korean ku/kunye allows them. These cross-linguistic differences lead to different transfer-based predictions for L1-Korean and L1-English L2-Mandarin learners. Sixty-two Mandarin native speakers, 42 L1-Korean L2ers, and 32 L1-English L2ers completed a picture-based Truth Value Judgment Task and a Mandarin proficiency test. Results show that proficiency-matched L2ers from both L1s predominantly allowed only local readings of ziji, suggesting that the local reading is the default option, and that Korean speakers do not transfer the properties of Korean simplex reflexives onto ziji, possibly because LD ziji is logophoric, while caki is not. Regarding ta, L1-Korean L2ers under-accepted LD readings and over-accepted local readings, a result that can be attributed to transfer, per Kim's analysis that Rule I, posited by Grodzinsky and Reinhart, that regulates the distribution of pronouns is weak or absent in Korean.","[Chen, Chung-yu] Natl Chengchi Univ, 64,Sec 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Ionin, Tania] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA",National Chengchi University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Chen, CY (corresponding author), Natl Chengchi Univ, 64,Sec 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",chungyu@nccu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Chung-yu/0000-0002-9603-8964",National Science Foundation [BCS1844447]; UIUC Graduate College Dissertation Travel Grant; UIUC SLATE Doctoral Research Award,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UIUC Graduate College Dissertation Travel Grant; UIUC SLATE Doctoral Research Award,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (BCS1844447), a UIUC Graduate College Dissertation Travel Grant, and a UIUC SLATE Doctoral Research Award.",,83,0,0,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-6583,1477-0326,,SECOND LANG RES,Second Lang.

Methods: Students in Korea National Sport University (KNSU) enrolled and in training during August to December 2017 completed the survey. Data from the survey was analyzed through path analysis. Results: Students who were training in the Department of Physical Education, KNSU (n = 624, 70% males, mean age 21.3 +/- 1.2) participated in this study. 15% of the respondents chose KM clinics for sports injuries, a higher rate than that of the general population, and 44% of KM interventions involved acupuncture. In the path analysis, sports injuries were positive predictors for utilization of medical services and the perception of KM, and KM utilization and the perception of KM were positive predictors of the willingness to receive KM treatments. Conclusions: The use of KM such as acupuncture was relatively high in elite collegiate athletes. The perception of KM and willingness to receive KM treatments were mediated by previous KM experiences. A higher accessibility towards KM treatments are necessary.

Conflicts between the dominant curatorial approach toward feminist arts and the identity politics of the Project L team are investigated in order to illustrate major theoretical predicaments in which lesbian activists and artists find themselves in feminist organizations and art exhibitions in Korea. As the title Globalizing Korean Queer suggests, this paper also examines contradictory circumstances related to the influence of queer theory in non-western countries. A close analysis of Gender Spectrum sheds light upon how a non-western lesbian group utilizes queer theory to understand the distinctive cultural conditions underlying homophobia, beyond merely importing advanced theories from the west.",,,"Koh, DY (corresponding author), Namsan Town Apt 32-1402, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,44,6,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

When the effects of background variables and baseline perceived health were controlled, baseline chronic conditions and changes in both chronic conditions and depressive symptoms were found to predict changes in perceived health. Older individuals who initially had more chronic conditions and those who had experienced an increasing number of chronic conditions and depressive symptoms over 2 years viewed their health more negatively at follow-up.

Despite these efforts, the participation rate of physical activity in Korean adolescents keeps decreasing. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze the perception of sports and physical activity in Korean adolescents through big data analysis of the last 10 years and to provide research data and statistical direction with regard to sports and physical activity participation in Korean adolescents. For data collection, data from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019 were collected from Naver (NAVER Corp., Seongnam, Korea), Daum (Kakao Corp., Jeju, Korea), and Google (Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), which are the most widely used search engines in Korea, using TEXTOM 4.0 (The Imc Inc., Daegu, Korea), a big data collection and analysis solution. Keywords such as adolescent + sports + physical activity were used. TEXTOM 4.0 can generate various collection lists at once using keywords. Collected data were processed through text mining (frequency analysis, term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis) and social network analysis (SNA) (degree centrality, convergence of iterated correlations analysis) by using TEXTOM 4.0 and UCINET 6 social network analysis software (Analytic Technologies Corp., Lexington, KY, USA). A total of 9278 big data (10.36 MB) were analyzed. Frequency analysis of the top 50 terms through text mining showed exercise (872), mind (851), health (824), program (782), and burden (744) in a descending order. Term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis revealed exercise (2108.070), health (1961.843), program (1928.765), mind (1861.837), and burden (1722.687) in a descending order. SNA showed that the terms with the greatest degree of centrality were exercise (0.02857), program (0.02406), mind (0.02079), health (0.02062), and activity (0.01872) in a descending order. Convergence of the iterated correlations analysis indicated five clusters: exercise and health, child to adult, sociocultural development, therapy, and program. However, female gender, sports for all, stress, and wholesome did not have a high enough correlation to form one cluster. Thus, this study provides basic data and statistical direction to increase the rate of physical activity participation in Korean adolescents by drawing significant implications based on terms and clusters through bid data analysis.","[Park, Sung-Un] Shingyeong Univ, Coll Arts & Phys Educ, Dept Sport & Leisure Studies, Hwaseong Si 18274, South Korea; [Ahn, Hyunkyun] Myongji Coll, Dept Sport & Leisure Studies, Div Arts & Hlth, Seoul 03656, South Korea; [Kim, Dong-Kyu] Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Technol Management, Dept Sport Management, Yongin 17104, South Korea; [So, Wi-Young] Korea Natl Univ Transportat, Coll Humanities & Arts, Chungju Si 27469, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea National University of Transportation,"Kim, DK (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Technol Management, Dept Sport Management, Yongin 17104, South Korea.;So, WY (corresponding author), Korea Natl Univ Transportat, Coll Humanities & Arts, Chungju Si 27469, South Korea.",psu@sgu.ac.kr; ahnhk@mjc.ac.kr; khudk04@khu.ac.kr; wowso@ut.ac.kr,"; Park, Sung-Un/AAJ-1086-2020","Park, Sung-Un/0000-0002-8518-6048; Kim, Dong-Kyu/0000-0003-4746-0381; Ahn, Hyunkyun/0009-0008-6307-2147; So, Wi-Young/0000-0002-9322-5852",,,,,47,20,20,0,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Korea National Sport University (KNSU) has played a crucial role in South Korea's rise as a global sporting powerhouse, contributing 100 Olympic medals within 40 years. This success is due to substantial investments in elite sports through centralized government sport-related policies. This study addresses the underexplored area of sport-specific institutions' roles in fostering athletic talent by investigating KNSU through qualitative methods, including literature review, historical analysis, case study and comparisons with international universities. Findings reveal KNSU's strategic focus on less popular individual events, maximizing impact with minimal resource allocation. By providing attractive benefits to student-athletes and coaches, investing in cutting-edge sports science and developing world-class facilities and training systems, KNSU has nurtured generations of champions. This model highlights KNSU's unique position as a global leader in elite athlete development. Beyond athletic achievements, KNSU's contributions extend to advancements in sports science and policy, shaping the landscape of elite sports in South Korea. This study underscores the potential of specialized institutions like KNSU to enhance national sporting success and offers valuable insights for policymakers and educators globally.","[Choi, Joohyun] Daejeon Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Park, Kwangho] Citadel Mil Coll South Carolina, Charleston, SC USA; [Lee, Jihyun] Korea Natl Sport Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Seungjin] Kyonggi Univ, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Misuk] Korea Inst Sport Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Korea National Sport University; Kyonggi University,"Kim, M (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sport Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",misukkim@kspo.or.kr,,"Choi, Joohyun/0000-0001-6043-5418",,,,,43,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-3367,1743-9035,,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

Inside the KPA, the military medical and veteran services were first established in February 1948. The military medical officers of the KPA were those who were initially engaged in North Korea's health care sector. Most of the early military medical officers were those who had been trained in the Japanese medical system before liberation and were surgeons. After the establishment of the government in September 1948, Lee Dongwha rapidly introduced the medical system of the Soviet army into the KPA. The KPA military medical system was a mix of Soviet, Japanese and Chinese military medical systems. The medical section of the KPA was similar to that of the Japanese army, and the medical section of the lower army was similar to that of the Soviet army. The stretcher platoon of the KPA were similar to those of the Japanese and Chinese armies. The KPA mainly used Japanese medical equipment at the beginning, and after the establishment of the North Korean regime in September 1948, they were gradually replaced with Soviet products. The military medical office of the KPA were equipped with treatment rooms, laboratories, hospitals, pharmacy, and inpatient rooms. The military medical office purchased medical journals and specimens for medical research and set up a separate research fund. In addition, the military medical office was equipped with a laboratory for medical experiments and raised laboratory animals. The KPA military medical system was specialized in the fields of infectious disease prevention and preventive medicine. At the time, infectious disease in North Korea was mainly caused by bacteria and viruses in unsanitary living environments. The KPA set up a special anti-infectious disease department in consideration of the soldiers living in the collective facilities. The second characteristic of the KPA military medical system is preventive medicine. Since early 1946, North Korea has been interested in preventive medicine and has established various medical facilities and personnel. In line with this history of preventive medicine, the preventive department was installed in the KPA military medical system.","[Kim, Seonho] Hanyang Univ, Res Inst Comparat Hist & Culture, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Res Inst Comparat Hist & Culture, Seoul, South Korea.",musoyu53@gmail.com,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2008-361-A00005],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This paper was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by Korean Government (NRF-2008-361-A00005).,,2,2,2,0,3,KOREAN SOC HIST MED,SEOUL,"SEOUL NAT UNIV, DEPT MED HIST, COLL MED, 28 YEONGEON-DONG, JONGRO-GU, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-505X,,,KOR J MED HIST,Kor.

The objective of this study is to add to the current understanding of lexical tone perception by comparing native speakers of standard Korean from the Seoul/Kyunggi area differing in Mandarin experience (NK1, NK2) with native speakers of Mandarin. NK1 (n = 10) had no experience with Mandarin whereas NK2 (n = 10) consisted of highly advanced learners of Mandarin. A group of 10 native Mandarin (NM) speakers was included as controls. Accuracy of perception of six tone pairs (T1-T2, T1-T3, T1-T4, T2-T3, T2-T4, T3-T4) was assessed in a four-alternative forced-choice discrimination test. As expected, the NK2 group with extensive Mandarin learning experience resembled the NM group to a greater extent than did the NK1 group. T2-T3 was the hardest pair for both NK groups, but NK2 had the largest advantage over NK1 for this pair. Apart from T2-T3 which is generally considered difficult, tone pairs involving T1 caused some misperception by the NK groups. This may be related to the difficulty with perceiving a level tone which shows the least fundamental frequency (F0) movement and possibly has limited perceptual salience.","[Tsukada, Kimiko] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Tsukada, Kimiko] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Han, Jeong-Im] Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Macquarie University; University of Oregon; Konkuk University,"Tsukada, K (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",kimiko.tsukada@gmail.com,"; Tsukada, Kimiko/I-6398-2019","Tsukada, Kimiko/0000-0001-6365-3322; Han, Jeong-Im/0000-0002-5871-5119;",11th Hakuho Foundation Japanese Research Fellowship (2016-17); 2018 Endeavour Research Fellowship,11th Hakuho Foundation Japanese Research Fellowship (2016-17); 2018 Endeavour Research Fellowship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the 11th Hakuho Foundation Japanese Research Fellowship (2016-17) and the 2018 Endeavour Research Fellowship.",,54,14,14,3,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-6583,1477-0326,,SECOND LANG RES,Second Lang.

Left liberals placed a great deal of blame for the outbreak of war on South Korean President Syngman Rhee, while conservatives and hawkish liberals used the occasion to lambast President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson. Hawkish liberals welcomed the possibility of a global showdown with Communism, while conservatives disapproved of US intervention in Korea for reasons both political and constitutional. In sum, the debate that dominated the pages of US opinion journals in the first weeks and months of the Korean War was both heated and robust, and exposes the ideological fault lines of the early cold war. To wit, hawkish liberals held positions that anticipated the birth of neoconservatism some two decades later. And conservative voices utilised their newfound platforms in The Freeman and The American Mercury to attack the Truman administration on a whole host of foreign-policy issues, revealing in greater detail than has previously been shown the role that international affairs played in the birth of the New American Right.","Carroll Coll, Helena, MT 59625 USA",,"Cash, DJ (corresponding author), Carroll Coll, Helena, MT 59625 USA.",dcash@carroll.edu,,,,,,,77,1,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0707-5332,1949-6540,,INT HIST REV,Int.

Investigating and studying this type of architecture not only can contribute to the reform of architectural history by understanding how ordinary buildings change over time and how they interact with people but also may suggest the possibility of, and methodology for developing long-lasting and sustainable mass housing in Korea and in Asian cities. The first part of the paper demonstrates the structural, spatial, and functional flexibilities of traditional Korean architecture. The second part investigates the construction system, including the organization of builders and the regulations governing the relationship with the residents. Its systematic construction approach is associated with the specialization of construction and standardization and prefabrication of elements, facilitating the easy replacement and reuse of building materials. The paper is based on a research methodology of integrating historical archives and case studies. The main argument posited here is that knowledge and skill of traditional construction of flexibility suggest conceptual strategies to improve current housing design and construction in order to obtain a sustainable future.","[Sung-Hwa, Kim] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Taegu, South Korea; [Beisi, Jia] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Kyungpook National University (KNU); University of Hong Kong,"Sung-Hwa, K (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Taegu, South Korea.",,,,,,,,18,2,3,0,23,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,SEP,2012,37,3,,,,,16,27,,,,,,12,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,009JV,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000309023000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the political relationship was upgraded to a strategic partnership in 2008, with ever-deepening economic interdependence and intensive societal exchanges, the two countries have entered a new and more complicated stage. The ROK's closer economic relationship with China is now coupled with a closer security alliance with the United States, while intensified societal exchange is being accompanied by the decline of positive feelings in Sino-Korean mutual perceptions. While the two sides have been able to manage the fallout of the Cheonan and Yeonpyeong tragedies in 2010, greater efforts are needed to place the relationship on a solid basis in the context of China's rise and the ROK's desire to find a larger international role for itself.","Fudan Univ, Sch Int Relat & Publ Affairs, Dept Int Polit, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Chen, ZM (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Int Relat & Publ Affairs, Dept Int Polit, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhmchen@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,43,2,3,0,21,"KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES",SEOUL,"28-42 SAMCHUNG-DONG, CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-230, SOUTH KOREA",0258-9184,,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,APR-JUN,2012,36,2,,,SI,,195,218,,10.1353/apr.2012.0007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/apr.2012.0007,,,24,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,951MH,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000304724200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis of K-pop star CL's (2013) song and video `Nappeun gijibae' ('The bad girl') demonstrates how the artist projects an assertive femininity by embodying and localising the Bad Bitch: a sexually agentive figure of womanhood from US hip hop. CL's use of African American English and conventionalised hip hop tropes helps resignify gijibae, a pejorative Korean term for women. By shifting between decontextualised styles invoking a different time and place, CL is able to build a kind of chronotopic capital that transforms fragmented styles into an empowered cosmopolitan femininity. However, although CL's performance challenges Korean gendered norms in its use of local linguistic resources, her selective appropriations of US Black and Chicanx cultural signifiers reproduce narrow images of racialised femininities and reify a hierarchy of valuation along lines of gender and race.","[Garza, Joyhanna Yoo] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Linguist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Garza, JY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Linguist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jyg@ucsb.edu,"Yoo, Joyhanna/ABD-3715-2021","Garza, Joyhanna/0000-0002-4857-5693",,,,,91,15,17,1,19,EQUINOX PUBLISHING LTD,SHEFFIELD,"415, THE WORKSTATION, 15 PATERNOSTER ROW, SHEFFIELD, S1 2BX, ENGLAND",1747-6321,1747-633X,,GENDER LANG,Gend.

Although much emphasis has been placed in Korean language learning and teaching on the importance of honorific styles, my article reveals that this at times has come at the expense of ignoring the other side of the coin: non-honorific language. Indeed, Korean language teaching materials delay the teaching of non-honorific language to intermediate level and then only deal with them in a perfunctory way. This is unfortunate as the pragmatics of non-honorific styles can be complex and learners frequently encounter these styles outside of class, even when their Korean level is rudimentary. I argue that this lack of emphasis on non-honorific language is not limited to Korean but represents a common tendency within language pedagogy to avoid language that is considered casual' or impolite'. With traditional teaching materials doing a poor job at representing these facets of language use, the solution I put forward is the use of multimedia activities. These activities are designed specifically to raise consciousness of the pragmatic factors influencing the use of non-honorific styles.","Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Brown, L (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",lucien@uoregon.edu,,"Brown, Lucien/0000-0002-9097-1649",,,,,34,20,24,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0790-8318,1747-7573,,LANG CULT CURRIC,Lang.

We investigated the association between socioeconomic status and the metabolic syndrome in Korean adults. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 8,541 subjects ages 20 to 79 years who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001. Socioeconomic status was measured by education and income level. RESULTS: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among this population was 29%. Relative to women with educational level < 7 years, those with educational levels of 7 to 9 years, 10 to 12 years, and > 13 years had odds ratios for the metabolic syndrome of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73 to 1.16), 0.55 (95% Cl: 0.44 to 0.70), and 0.31 (95% Cl: 0.22 to 0.43), respectively (p for trend < 0.05). Relative to women with lower income, those with middle and upper income had odds ratios for the metabolic syndrome of 0.90 (95% Cl: 0.75 to 1.08) and 0.80 (95% Cl: 0.66 to 0.97), respectively (p for trend < 0.05). A significant association between the metabolic syndrome and socioeconomic status was not observed in men. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with a higher risk of the metabolic syndrome in Korean women but not in Korean men.","Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Seoul 138736, South Korea",University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center,"Park, HS (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, 388-1 Poongnap Dong, Seoul 138736, South Korea.",hyesoon@amc.seoul.kr,"Park, Min/C-4295-2013",,,,,,27,72,77,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1047-2797,1873-2585,,ANN EPIDEMIOL,Ann.

Although the nationwide anti-smoking efforts and American individualism-oriented cultural system seem to help some Korean American men stop smoking, many of them still smoke. Thus, it is necessary to understand factors influencing decisions to continue smoking or stop smoking among older Korean American men. We recruited a convenience sample of 24 Korean American men (12 current smokers, 12 former smokers) who were aged 55-79 years to participate in this qualitative study. Five focus groups and nine individual interviews were conducted. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Participants were older (mean age = 69 years) and have lived in the United States an average of 26 years. Average duration of smoking was 41 years among current smokers and 31 years among former smokers. Key themes influencing continuous smoking include stress relief, fear of side effects, difficulty stopping, smoking peers, and misbeliefs about lung cancer and smoking, whereas key themes for decisions to stop smoking include present health issues, family/physician/media recommendation, and smoking-restricted environments. This study reinforces the importance of culturally and age-relevant smoking cessation programs targeting smokers and their families. Future quantitative studies in different geographic areas can validate the study findings.","[Sin, Mo-Kyung; Ro, KumHee] Seattle Univ, Coll Nursing, 901 12th Ave POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA",Seattle University,"Sin, MK (corresponding author), Seattle Univ, Coll Nursing, 901 12th Ave POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",sinm@seattleu.edu; rok@seattleu.edu,,"Sin, Mo-Kyung/0000-0001-7482-1782",Seattle University Summer Faculty Fellowship,Seattle University Summer Faculty Fellowship,Acknowledgment This study was funded by Seattle University Summer Faculty Fellowship.

Four participants' verbal data were collected before and after the four-step instruction targeting collocation dictionary skills. The analyses of the protocol data obtained before the instruction showed that EFL learners rely heavily on checking example sentences in a bilingualised dictionary using entry words in their L1; not infrequently, they attempt to fix lexical errors based on logical reasoning or using synonyms in context, which makes collocational error correction widely inconsistent. After receiving the instruction, all participants made marked progress in improving the correction rate. More importantly, their dictionary consultation behaviour for collocation revision, or production, was found to have changed. Such results underline the pedagogical necessity of teaching collocation dictionary skills in L2 writing classes to foster collocational competence and learner autonomy.","[Kim, Sugene] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Dept English Studies, Sagamine 4-4 Komenokicho, Nisshin, Aichi 4700193, Japan",Nagoya University of Commerce & Business,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Dept English Studies, Sagamine 4-4 Komenokicho, Nisshin, Aichi 4700193, Japan.",sugene_kim@nucba.ac.jp,,"Kim, Sugene/0000-0001-9514-7416",,,,,65,7,7,4,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0950-3846,1477-4577,,INT J LEXICOGR,Int.

This is a pilot study for family-based association analysis of schizophrenia in a Korean population to search candidate genes functionally relevant and positionally on chromosome 18. Methods: We have recruited 27 probands (with psychosis) with their parents and siblings whenever possible. We analyzed 20 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) of seven neuronal genes in chromosome 18 for DNA samples that was checked for the data quality and genotype error. For testing of association, we performed family-based association tests analyses with each individual SNP, using the phenotype of psychosis. And then, we performed family-based association tests haplotype analyses with each individual SNP, using the phenotype of psychosis. Finally, we performed linkage disequilibrium analyses for the phenotype of schizophrenia. Results: We found one significant SNPs of one neuronal gene in chromosome 18 (P value < 0.05) for the qualitative phenotype of psychosis (rs1893490:MAPK4). We also found significant haplotypes of four SNPs in mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) gene of chromosome 18 (P value < 0.1) for the phenotype of psychosis (rs1893490-rs3892158-rs3752088-rs3794899). Two SNPS within the MAPK4 gene (rs3794899, rs3794901), plus SNPs within the malic enzyme 2 (rs685533, rs12277), and SMAD4 genes (rs8096092, rs2298617) were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (D' > 0.60). Discussion: The present findings provide convergent evidence (fine mapping of a chromosomal locus 18q21 associated with schizophrenia) suggesting that a specific MAPK4 could be a candidate gene for causing a spectrum of schizophrenia phenotype.","[Cho, Min Jung] Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Busan 602739, South Korea; [Lee, Byung Dae] Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Busan 602739, South Korea; [Lee, Byung Dae] Pusan Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Kyungnam, South Korea; [Cho, Min Jung; Lee, Byung Dae] Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Med Res Inst, Busan 602739, South Korea; [Kim, Choongrak] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Busan, South Korea",Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University; Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University,"Lee, BD (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 305 Gudeok Ro, Busan 602739, South Korea.",bdlee@pusan.ac.kr,"Cho, Minjung/HDO-5031-2022",,,,,,35,8,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5864,1758-5872,,ASIA-PAC PSYCHIAT,Asia-Pac.

Although many studies have been conducted on different racial groups, less is known about arterial stiffness in Asian Americans. Korean Americans constitute the fifth largest subgroup in the Asian American population and reportedly have a noticeably high prevalence of hypertension. The aims of this study were to assess arterial stiffness and blood pressure and to examine the effect of age and gender on arterial stiffness and blood pressure in 102 Korean American men and women aged 21 to 60 years. The values of arterial stiffness for Korean Americans in this study were compared to published reference values for other racial and ethnic groups. Arterial stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, which is the gold standard for determining arterial stiffness. Findings indicated that aging was an important determinant of arterial stiffness, which increased linearly with age. Although there was no gender difference observed in arterial stiffness, the effect of age on arterial stiffness was greater in women than in men. After adjusting for covariates including age, body mass index, and smoking, multiple regression models showed that arterial stiffness and gender were significant predictors of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The comparisons of these findings to those from several other studies that used the same method to measure arterial stiffness showed that Korean Americans may have levels of arterial stiffness that are similar to or slightly higher than those of other racial groups. Considering that arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of future development of hypertension, more studies are required to examine cardiovascular risk of this understudied group.","[Logan, Jeongok G.; Barksdale, Debra J.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Nursing, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Logan, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Nursing, Carrington CB 7460, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",gang@email.unc.edu,,,Ruth L.

Elite narratives in Japan and South Korea reify the bilateral relationship as a difficult problem. For the Japanese policy elites, the difficulty is due to South Korean unwillingness to embrace a future-oriented relationship; whereas for the South Korean policy elites, the source of the problem is the unwillingness of the Japanese to sincerely address past wrong-doing. The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy of an intractable mutual misapprehension, suggesting that the difficult relationship is here to stay. I analyse pronouncements by both the Japanese and South Korean policy elites appearing in official documents and media reports for clues into the manner in which the bilateral relationship is reified into a difficulty purportedly due to the recalcitrance of the neighbour. The narratives consistently show that both the Japanese and South Korean policy elites consider the onus of improvement lies with the troublesome/insincere neighbour. In short, the bilateral relationship is a clash of realities, with the logical conclusion being that the difficult relationship will persist for the foreseeable future.","[Tamaki, Taku] Loughborough Univ, Polit & Int Studies POLIS, Sch Social Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Tamaki, T (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Polit & Int Studies POLIS, Sch Social Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",T.Tamaki@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,91,8,8,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1468-1099,1474-0060,,JPN J POLIT SCI,Jpn.

Using data from the 2015 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, we identified the major stressors among Korean adolescents based on gender, current educational level, residential area, and socioeconomic status (SES). The major stressors among girls were relationship- and appraisal-related factors, whereas boys more often reported health- and conflict-related factors. High school students more often reported academic performance and family circumstances as major stressors, whereas middle school students tended to report conflict-related factors. Urban adolescents reported academic performance and conflicts with parents as major stressors while rural adolescents reported conflicts with teachers and peer relationship problems. Finally, adolescents of lower SES reported multiple factors, including relational and family problems, as major stressors; contrarily, among those of higher SES, the primary stressor was uniquely related to academic performance. This result is significant in that adolescents' stress levels, as well as the types of major stressors, vary depending on individual factors. It could also be beneficial for developing and implementing individualized and thus more efficient stress-management strategies.","[Park, Subin; Jang, Hyesue] Natl Ctr Mental Hlth, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Dept Res Planning, Seoul 04933, South Korea; [Lee, Eun-Sun] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Park, S (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Mental Hlth, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Dept Res Planning, Seoul 04933, South Korea.",subin-21@hanmail.net; hsjang0315@gmail.com; chachagrace918@gmail.com,,"Park, Subin/0000-0002-4623-9899",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government [NRF-2014R1A1A3049818],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014R1A1A3049818).,,47,12,13,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The Korean economy exhibited increasing returns to scale and labor saving and capital using embodied technological progress. Capital accumulation and TFP growth are the proximate source of output growth. TFP growth includes the estimated embodied capital-using technological change. The technological change is as much as one and half times TFP growth between 1969 and 2000. Hence, investment is the most important engine of growth. (c) 2005 Society for Policy Modeling.

Rhodes (2005) argued that mentoring may benefit adolescents with high parental attachment because social engagement comes easily to them, and that it also may benefit adolescents with weak attachment because of greater need. The present study drew on Rhodes' (2005) theory to postulate curvilinear moderation of the mentoring-depression relationship by parental attachment. Teacher and peer attachment were posited as mediators of the relationship between mentoring and depression. Using fixed effects regression models, Sobel tests, and nonparametric bootstraps to test the hypotheses, a negative association was identified between mentoring and depression symptoms. Results suggested mediation by social withdrawal, and models also found a significant curvilinear moderating effect of parental attachment on the mentoring-depression relationship. These findings suggest that adolescent North Korean refugees with strong parental attachment and adolescent North Korean refugees with weak parental attachment may disproportionately benefit from mentoring as compared with adolescent North Korean refugees who scored in the middle in parental attachment. These results are also consistent with the idea that mentoring may reduce social withdrawal which, in turn, reduces depression.","[Emery, Clifton R.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Work & Social Adm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hyerin] Yonsei Univ, Sch Social Welf, 100 Baekyang Ro,Appenzeller Bldg, Seoul, South Korea",University of Hong Kong; Yonsei University,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Social Welf, 100 Baekyang Ro,Appenzeller Bldg, Seoul, South Korea.",hyerin.yang.hk@gmail.com,,"Emery, Clifton/0000-0001-7662-2509",,,,,92,2,2,0,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0022-4405,1873-3506,,J SCHOOL PSYCHOL,J.

We aimed to define clinically relevant cut-off points for older Korean people and to compare the predictive validity with other definitions of sarcopenia. Methods: Nine hundred and sixteen older Koreans (>= 65 years) were included in this cross-sectional observational study. We used conditional inference tree analysis to determine cut-off points for height-adjusted grip strength (GS) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), for use in the diagnosis of sarcopenia. We then compared the Korean sarcopenia criteria with the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria, using frailty, assessed with the Korean Frailty Index, as an outcome variable. Results: For men, a residual GS (GS(re)) of <= 0.25 was defined as weak, and a residual ASM (ASM(re)) of <= 1.29 was defined as low. Corresponding cut-off points for women were a GS(re) of <= 0.17 and an ASM(re) of <= 0.69. GS(re) and ASM(re) values were adjusted for height. In logistic regression analysis with new cut-off points, the adjusted odds ratios for pre-frail or frail status in the sarcopenia group were 3.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-7.83) for the men and 1.74 (95% CI 0.91-3.35) for the women. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the unadjusted area under the curve for Korean sarcopenia criteria in men and women were 0.653 and 0.608, respectively (p<.001). Conclusions: Our proposed cut-off points for low GS and low ASM should be useful in the diagnosis of sarcopenia in older Korean people.","[Choe, Yu-Ri; Joh, Ju-Youn; Kim, Yeon-Pyo] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Family Med, Hwasun Hosp, 322 Seoyang Ro, Hwasun Gun, Chonnam, South Korea; [Kim, Yeon-Pyo] Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Gwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Chonnam National University,"Kim, YP (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Family Med, Hwasun Hosp, 322 Seoyang Ro, Hwasun Gun, Chonnam, South Korea.",ypkim@jnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,9,9,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1079-5006,1758-535X,,J GERONTOL A-BIOL,J.

Also, it was intended to provide guidelines for reducing internet overuse based on the influencing factors of internet use. METHODS: Participants in this study were convenient sampling, and selected middle and high school students in Incheon metropolitan city, South Korea. Internet use and mental health of adolescents were measured by self-reported instruments. This study was carried out from June to July 2014. 1248 participants were collected overall except for insufficient data. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple regression. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between mental health and internet use. The significant influencing factors of internet use were normal internet use group, mental health, middle school, internet using time on weekends (3 h or more), internet using time at a time (3 h or more), and high school record. These six variables accounted for 38.1% of internet use. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will be used as guidelines for reducing internet overuse of adolescents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Design: Survey research using a self-report questionnaire. Settings: Field survey on convenience sample in California and in Seoul, Korea. Participants: 225 KA and 216 Korean mothers. Main Outcome Measures: Frequency of eating at home, preparation of Korean foods, favorite dishes of families, and for special occasions. Analysis: Chi-square, t test, and analysis of variance. Results: Families of the more acculturated mothers dined out more frequently and had lower preferences for Korean foods than did the families with less acculturated mothers. The more acculturated mothers prepared Korean foods, including kimchi, less at home. Fewer Korean dishes were included among the 5 favored dishes, both for family and for special occasions, in KA families than in Korean families. The acculturation stage of the mothers affected preference for Korean dishes of the families but not for special occasions. Conclusions and Implications: Mothers' acculturation stage influenced the family's eating habits. Changes of preference of typical Korean dishes varied by acculturation stage.

Good subjective health was significantly associated with frequent information sharing while individuals with a history of disease involving themselves or family members were more likely to share health information than were those without such a history. Further, a higher level of depressed mood was related to a higher level of sharing. Internet-related self-efficacy and trust in information delivery channels were positively related to sharing.

Methods: Among a panel of subjected enrolled in existing domestic survey companies, adults aged 19 to 59 yr old who replied that their drinking frequency was more than once a month for the past one year were selected in 2017. Sample size and methods used for analysis were determined by considering demographically proportioned stratified sampling and monthly alcohol drinking rate. A total of 1,185 subjects (731 males and 454 females) responded to questionnaires. Results: Most drinking behaviors were in the domain. of leisure time. Drinking for two or more times a month and hinge drinking were mainly concentrated in five occasions types: going out with friends (44.2%), going out with coleague (34.2%), drinking at home or friend's home with friends (32.9%), drinking at home alone (29.3%), and drinking with meals at home (27.5%). Regarding the ratio of experiences in drinking for subjects according to occupations, 'Directors/Managers' who participated in receptions of guests, either hosted by or invited thereto, had the highest percentage (64.2%), followed by 'Individual Proprietors' (56.4%). Differences between each type of occupation were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The drinking culture in Korea was characterized by more social drinking than by drinking alone at home. The drinking behavior was often one-shot at a time rather than drinking a little sip.

A dearth of information exists about which types of leisure activities are associated with acculturation among immigrants. This study focused on 434 Korean immigrants in order to determine what types of leisure activities were associated with behavioural acculturation (e.g. language usage and social context) and cultural value acculturation (e.g. collectivism, self-control and success). The results showed that participation in hobbies and indoor activities were the positive predictors of behavioural acculturation, while engagement in cultural and volunteer activities was the negative predictors of behavioural acculturation. In addition, cultural value acculturation had a positive association with social activity engagement, but had a negative association with participation in physical, cultural and volunteering activities. Overall, these findings indicated that engaging in leisure activities is positively associated with acculturation. This study suggests that leisure engagement can be beneficial in the successful acculturation process of the Korean immigrant in Western society.","[Kim, Junhyoung] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Recreat Pk & Leisure Serv Adm, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Heo, Jinmoo] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Recreat Pk & Tourism Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lee, Chungsup] Univ Illinois, Dept Recreat Sport & Tourism, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Central Michigan University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Recreat Pk & Leisure Serv Adm, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",kim10j@cmich.edu,"Heo, Jinmoo/AFT-1753-2022","Kim, Junhyoung/0000-0001-5366-0270",,,,,58,32,34,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0261-4367,1466-4496,,LEISURE STUD,Leis.

Although the high prevalence of HBP among Korean Americans (KAs) is well documented, few dietary interventions have been implemented in this population, in part because of a lack of culturally relevant nutrition education guidelines. Translating and testing the efficacy of culturally relevant dietary recommendations using a well-established dietary guideline such as DASH are imperative for promoting better cardiovascular health for this high-risk cultural group. Objective: The aims of this study were to systematically translate and validate a culturally modified DASH for Koreans (K-DASH) and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy. Methods: A 2-step approach of intervention translation and efficacy testing, together with close adherence to principles of community-based participatory research, was used to maximize community input. A 1-group pre-post design with 24-hour urine and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring comparisons was used to test the initial feasibility and efficacy of the K-DASH intervention. Results: A total of 28 KAs with HBP participated in a 10-week dietary intervention consisting of group education sessions and individual counseling. Both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, were significantly decreased at postintervention evaluation (systolic blood pressure, -4.5 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, -2.6 mm Hg; P < .05). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased (-7.3 mg/dL; P < .05). Serum potassium and ascorbic acid levels were also improved in the reference range. Urine potassium level was significantly increased, supporting increased fruit and vegetable consumption. Conclusion: This pilot study has (a) demonstrated that a cultural adaptation of DASH using community-based participatory research methodology produced a culturally relevant and efficacious dietary intervention for the KAs with HBP and (b) provided strong preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the K-DASH intervention in reducing HBP in hypertensive KAs.","[Kim, Hyerang; Song, Hee-Jung; Han, Hae-Ra] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kim, Kim B.] Korean Resource Ctr, Ellicott City, MD USA; [Kim, Miyong T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kim, Miyong T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University,"Kim, MT (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Nursing, 525 North Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mkim11@jhu.edu,"lee, hy/GRS-0797-2022",,"National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [UL1 RR 025005]; NIH Roadmap for Medical Research","National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIH Roadmap for Medical Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This publication was made possible by grant no.

The present study examined vowels produced by Korean-English bilingual children of these same ages to determine whether and when bilinguals establish distinct vowel categories across their 2 languages. Method: Both English and Korean vowels produced by 40 Korean-English bilingual children (5 and 10 years of age) were examined in terms of 1st formant frequency (F1) and 2nd formant frequency (F2), vowel duration, and F1 and F2 formant trajectories. Results: Formant frequencies of vowels produced by the bilingual children were similar to those of monolingual English and Korean children. The bilinguals distinguished vowel categories across languages using both the assimilation and dissimilation mechanisms as identified by Flege, Schirru, and MacKay (2003). Conclusions: Vowel categories developed earlier than stops in bilingual children because vowels were typically acquired earlier than consonants. The results of this study suggest that detailed phonetic categories do not form across the board and that bilingual children may invoke multidimensional representations of phonetic categories.","[Lee, Sue Ann S.] Texas Tech Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Lubbock, TX 79430 USA; [Iverson, Gregory K.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Lubbock; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Lee, SAS (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Lubbock, TX 79430 USA.",sueann.lee@ttuhsc.edu,,"Lee, Sue Ann/0000-0002-2970-0591",National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [RHD061527A],National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This study has been supported by National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Grant RHD061527A.

Image here is that which is not an impression of reality, but a perception of matter that approximates the verisimilitudes of both space and time that may not have anything to do with reality. This renders a sense of the unknowable. This article probes a number of elements that typify Park's films: the trope of revenge and its relationship with Nietzschean ressentiment, the stylized use of violence, the failing gap between the plane of representation and the plane of signification, and the various spatial, historical, and ontological markers of the unknowable. All of these issues will also investigate, challenge, and contextuaiize the recent Western critics' response to his work that has problematized Park's films for having failing to produce social criticism.","Univ Calif Irvine, Film & Video Ctr, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Hyun, KK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Film & Video Ctr, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",kyunghk@uci.edu,,,,,,,11,3,4,0,6,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,SPR,2006,46,1,,,,,84,108,,,,,,25,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,043DF,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000237578900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This tendency has been widely reported in patients from East Asian cultural contexts suffering from depression. Recent research in two Chinese samples have demonstrated that the local cultural script for depression, involving two aspects the experience and expression of distress (EED) and conceptualization and communication of distress (CCD) can be evoked to help explain somatization. Given the beliefs and practices broadly shared across Chinese and South Korean cultural contexts, the current study seeks to replicate this explanatory model in South Koreans. Methods: Our sample included 209 psychiatric outpatients from Seoul and Wonju, South Korea. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess somatization tendency, adherence to traditional values, and psychological and somatic symptoms of depression. Results: Results from SEM showed that the EED and CCD factors of somatization tendency were differently associated with cultural values and somatic symptoms, replicating our previous findings in Chinese outpatients. Limitations: The reliance on a brief self-report measure of somatization tendency, not originally designed to assess separate EED and CCD factors, highlights the need for measurement tools for the assessment of cultural scripts in cross-cultural depression research. Conclusions: The replication of the Chinese structural model of somatization in South Korea lends empirical support to the view that somatization can be understood as the consequence of specific cultural scripts. These scripts involve the experience and expression of distress as well as culturally meaningful ways in which this distress is conceptualized and communicated to others. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Though religion's benefits are well-studied, few investigations have provided quantitative and explorative perspectives on its effects. Most studies concern religion's influence on specific psychological aspects of the human mind. This study investigated whether people's language use reflects the effects of religious training. We analyzed writing samples from 12 new believers in the Catholic Church via a language analysis program and conducted relevant psychological tests. The results showed language patterns changed significantly with religious training, even though these changes did not show any correlations with the psychological scales. These results indicate that religiosity can be reflected in certain language behaviors. Moreover, the results suggest language usage can be a reliable and sensitive index for measuring religiosity.","[Jang, Jiho] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 130791, South Korea; [Kim, Kyungil] Ajou Univ, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Park, Jongmin] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Chang H.] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Ajou University; Kyung Hee University; Sogang University,"Jang, J (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",jhufs@hufs.ac.kr,"Lee, Chang-Hwan/B-3096-2015","Park, Jongmin/0000-0002-8997-6135",,,,,31,1,1,0,16,PSYCHOLOGIA SOC,KYOTO,"DEPT EDUC PSYCHOL FAC EDUC KYOTO UNIV, KYOTO, 606, JAPAN",0033-2852,,,PSYCHOLOGIA,Psychologia,SEP,2011,54,3,,,,,145,155,,10.2117/psysoc.2011.145,http://dx.doi.org/10.2117/psysoc.2011.145,,,11,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Psychology,858DQ,,Bronze,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000297776500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study, therefore, aimed to explore the prevalence of unmet healthcare needs, and examine its associated factors among adolescents in Korea based on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services, using data from the Seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016 to 2018). This survey's data source comprised 12- to 18-year-old adolescents, of which 1425 provided information on their unmet healthcare needs, as well as their predisposing, enabling, and need factors. For statistical analysis, SPSS version 25.0 was used. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess each variable, whereas multiple logistic regression was used to determine the associated factors. The overall prevalence of unmet healthcare needs was 5.5%. The factors that had statistically significant relationships with adolescents' unmet healthcare needs were: age; stress perceptions; housing types; and perceived health status. Unlike previous studies that presented related factors on vulnerable groups, this study's results presented unmet healthcare needs and related factors for all Korean adolescents using a national survey dataset. Hence, its findings could provide feedback on current policies, and guide future studies.","[Park, Hyeran] Hanyang Univ, Coll Nursing, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Park, Hyeran] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Park, Jeongok] Yonsei Univ, Mo Im Kim Nursing Res Inst, Coll Nursing, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Hanyang University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Park, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Mo Im Kim Nursing Res Inst, Coll Nursing, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",tigress1204@gmail.com; jopark02@yuhs.ac,"Park, Hyeran/KBQ-2466-2024; Park, Jeongok/MDT-2189-2025","Park, Hyeran/0000-0002-0182-8542",,,,,46,4,4,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The aims of the present study were to describe the development of a Korean version of the CD-RISC (K-CD-RISC) and to more firmly establish its psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity. The participants consisted of a general population sample (n?=?194) and psychiatric outpatients (n?=?127) with non-psychotic mood or anxiety disorders. The K-CD-RISC score means (standard deviation) were 65.9 (13.6) in the general population and 50.4 (20.5) in the psychiatric outpatients. The mean score of the general population was significantly higher than that of the psychiatric outpatients. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors, and the obtained factor structure was verified through confirmatory factor analysis. In the general population, the Cronbach's a coefficient of the K-CD-RISC was found to be 0.92. Greater resilience was found to be associated with less perceived stress, anxiety and depression and with higher levels of positive affect and purpose in life. Taken together, our findings suggest that the K-CD-RISC has good psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable tool for assessing resilience.

Since Kang published the series in 1988, it served as a metaphor of the unequal relationship between South Korea and the United States forged amidst Cold War politics. Deviating from this indexical interpretation, this article restores Kang's photographs back to the belated moment of private commemoration, highlighting the racial specificity of the sitters in segregated entertainment venues. This re-temporalisation reveals unexpected banality and silence pervasive in the photos, disconnected from the zeal and hubbub rampant in the Seoul Olympics and the Minjung movement during the 1980s. The photos feature Dongducheon as a refuge where minor feelings could remain untouched, highlighting overlooked forms of solidarity among the marginalised figures - black GIs and Korean prostitutes - at the crossroads of racial discrimination and misogyny.",,,,,,"Chang, Haely/0009-0005-6253-1581",,,,,54,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-8822,1475-5297,,THIRD TEXT,Third Text,NOV 2,2023,37,5-6,,,,,616,634,,10.1080/09528822.2023.2294656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2023.2294656,,NOV 2023,19,Art,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Art,GF2V8,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001140590200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Guided by the work of Rhacel Salazar Parrenas, Benita Parry, Kyung Hyun Kim and Tobias Hubinette, the authors show how the portrayal of transnational adoption practices and of adoptees in Korean cinema is fraught with cultural antagonisms - between the adoptees' agency and their lost bloodlines, hierarchical relations and lasting bonds, ethnicity and cultural capital - and distorted by a tendency to commodify the theme as a cinematic motif. Discovering these cultural antagonisms across successive decades, this article argues that the narrative in nearly all adoption films remains passive with regard to issues of abandonment. As a result adoptees are misrepresented and the negative effects of transnational adoption practices are never fully resolved, culturally or politically. It is precisely because of this passive strategy that adoptees are conceived, dubiously and tragically, as nothing more than partial citizens' in most Korean cinema.","[Yoo, Ji Young] Pukyong Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea; [Yoo, Ji Young] Dong Eui Univ, Pusan, South Korea; [Wagner, Keith B.] Hongik Univ, Grad Sch Film & Digital Media, Seoul, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Dong-Eui University; Hongik University,"Yoo, JY (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea.",,,,,,,,23,3,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-8822,1475-5297,,THIRD TEXT,Third Text,SEP 1,2013,27,5,,,,,659,673,,10.1080/09528822.2013.834579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2013.834579,,,15,Art,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Art,234XT,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000325678300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

I interpret both South Korea's long abstinence and its subsequent efforts to upgrade its missile capability as strategies dictated by South Korea's dual identity: it is a medium power in a global sense and yet a small state within the context of its regional security situation.

While considerable discussion has already taken place in the Korean academic community across various fields, including philosophy, theology, and political science, many of which propose ssial philosophy as the metaphysical foundation of his political thoughts, there still remains a need for a more systematic understanding of their relationship, which I argue is closely linked to his concept of jeonilhwa gwajeong (the process of unification/integration). By exploring Ham's unique analysis, particularly in relation to the notion of ipcheseong (stereoscopic/multi-dimensional), this paper will underscore their shared roots and objectives across different spheres of life: one pertaining to salim (human affairs) seeking the pursuit of fairness and equality, and the other dealing with spirituality, aspiring to grasp the sublime aspects of human existence. Both religion and politics, as these movements are termed, are mutually dependent, with their culmination promising peace and harmony in historical reality. Through highlighting Ham's integrated perspective on religion and politics, I will ultimately suggest a specific discourse-civil religion-as a theoretical framework to effectively unravels Ham's viewpoints.","[Lee, Song-Chong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Religious Studies, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, SC (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Religious Studies, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",songchonglee@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Song Chong/AAY-1982-2021","Lee, Song-Chong/0000-0002-6209-8432",,,,,27,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,MAY,2024,15,5,,,,,,,601,10.3390/rel15050601,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel15050601,,,16,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,RZ2W2,,gold,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001231424300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Churches and clergy play a fundamental role in their lives, as a form of social organization and alternative to community services. Purpose: To describe the implementation and evaluation of an intervention for Korean American faith leaders designed to increase knowledge about IPV and about resources to handle IPV, strengthen attitudes that do not support IPV, enhance self-efficacy to handle IPV, and increase prevention and intervention behaviors about IPV. Methods: Korean American faith leaders in a Southeastern state of the USA were invited to participate in the study (n = 55). Participants completed two online assessments: baseline and a 3-month follow-up. After the baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either the intervention (n = 27) or the control (n = 28) group. The intervention consisted of three online modules, each taking approximately 30-45 min to complete. Modules were developed based on the researchers' work with Korean American faith leaders. Assessments and interventions were available in Korean and English. Results: Compared to the control group, the intervention group significantly improved their knowledge of resources and enhanced attitudes against IPV. The intervention group increased their self-efficacy and behaviors to prevent IPV more than the control group, but these changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The online training provided a safe and convenient environment for the Korean American clergy, for whom anonymity and convenient access were important. Results are promising, but highlight the need to include more specific training of skills, which could be incorporated into the online modules in the form of an avatar. This online training could serve as a template to be adapted for other immigrant groups.","[Choi, Y.

More specifically, we extend our analysis to the embodied resources, including gestures and nonverbal behaviour, that people use when enacting politeness talk. The data comes from two semi-structured interviews that we conducted with South Korean participants, both of whom were middle-aged university professors. We subjected the data to three rounds of analysis. First, we thematically coded the content of the narratives, revealing important differences in how these two participants from the same language background conceived of politeness. Second, we analyzed the appearance of verbal and non-verbal markers of deferential politeness. This analysis revealed that the overall bodily comportment of the two participants closely matched the different politeness narratives that they inhabited. Third and finally, we examined how the participants used bodily movements when evoking specific embodied practices related to politeness, and used embodied behaviours to represent abstract politeness-related concepts and map them onto spatial locations. Overall, the analysis shows that metapragmatic talk about politeness is an embodied achievement and thus needs to be treated within the remit of the multimodal turn in politeness research.","[Brown, Lucien] Monash Univ, Sch Languages Literatures Cultures & Linguist, Menzies Bldg,20 Chancellors Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kim, Soung-U] SOAS Univ London, Dept East Asian Languages & Cultures, London, England; [Kim, Hyunji] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept World Languages & Cultures, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",Monash University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Brown, L (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Languages Literatures Cultures & Linguist, Menzies Bldg,20 Chancellors Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Lucien.brown@monash.edu; sk138@soas.ac.uk; hkim138@kennesaw.edu,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2016-LAB-2250003],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (https://doi.org/10.13039/501100019898) under the grant AKS-2016-LAB-2250003.,,48,5,5,0,23,DE GRUYTER MOUTON,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, 10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1612-5681,1613-4877,,J POLITENESS RES-LAN,J.

We asked Korean students to perform a sequence of tasks, once to a professor (deferential condition) and once to a close friend (intimate condition) and analysed the production of a wide range of morphological and lexical forms, as well as nonverbal sound objects. Our analysis shows that the participants not only increased their use of address and referent honorifics when addressing the professor, but also increased their use of backchannels and 'hissing' sound objects, and decreased their use of um-/uhtype sound objects, case particle ellipsis, and ideophones. There were also weaker tendencies for participants to use more formal case markers and Sino-Korean lexical items when addressing the professor. Taken together, these results demonstrate that deference and intimacy are indexed via multiple channels, not just through the honorific markers that have been the focus of previous studies.

Amongst British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand troops deployed to the Far East, rates of VD peaked at 387 cases per 1,000. Levels of infection far exceeded those recorded during the Second World War. Over the past several decades, historians have explored the intimate lives of fighting men throughout the twentieth century in great detail. Be that as it may, the Korean War has received little attention. This article represents the first analysis of the Common wealth experience of VD. It examines how widespread the problem became, as well as the efforts to which officials went to reduce levels of infection.

Methods: A total of 2767 randomly selected subjects from the Ansan Geriatric Study were questioned on their knowledge of putative risk factors for AD. Their answers were compared with their sociodemographic data and other variables. Results: The most common stated risk factor was being older (59.6%), followed by head trauma (33.6%) and cerebrovascular disease (30.4%). However, a substandard education, which is a known risk factor, was considered significant by only 9.5% of the subjects. Predictors for a worse knowledge of the risk factors for AD were being older, a lower level of education, lower economic status and the attitude that dementia is not curable. Conclusion: This study revealed that misunderstanding about AD is more prevalent in older subjects and those with a lower level of education, and so public health education on the basic concepts of AD should be targeted at this population.","[Han, Changsu] Korea Univ, Med Ctr, Ansan Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Ansan 425707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Moon Ho; Park, Min Kyu] Korea Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Ansan 425707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Moon Ho; Han, Changsu; Park, Min Kyu] Korea Univ, Med Ctr, Geriatr Hlth Clin & Res Inst, Ansan 425707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Jo, Sangmee Ahn; Jo, Inho; Kim, Eunkyung; Woo, Eun Kyung; Kim, Sung-Soo; Eun, Su-Yong] Natl Inst Hlth, Ctr Biomed Sci, Seoul 122701, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency (KDCA); Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH); Korea CDC Center for Biomedical Science,"Han, C (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Med Ctr, Ansan Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 516 Gojan 1 Dong, Ansan 425707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",hancs@korea.ac.kr,"Han, Changsu/H-9926-2013; Kim, Seok-Hwan/G-9981-2015; Jo, Inho/R-3581-2019","Han, Changsu/0000-0002-4021-8907; Kim, Seok-Hwan/0000-0003-0209-0444; Park, Moon Ho/0000-0002-4892-3475",,,,,21,5,5,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1601-5215,,,ACTA NEUROPSYCHIATR,Acta Neuropsychiatr.,FEB,2008,20,1,,,,,20,24,,10.1111/j.1601-5215.2007.00230.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1601-5215.2007.00230.x,,,5,Neurosciences; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,256CL,25385386,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000252705200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

As an initial trial, various factors chosen from the literature for their predictive relationships to wandering of Korean PWDs were evaluated in this study. Method: A total of 160 PWDs residing in 14 long-term care facilities participated in this study. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Physical Activities of Daily Living (PADL) and Korean-translated Revised Algase Wandering Scale (Nursing Home version) (KRAWS-NH) were used to assess participants' degree of cognitive impairment, functional ability and wandering behaviour on six dimensions: persistent walking (PW), specific patterns (SP), spatial disorientation (SD), escape behaviour (EB), attention shift (AS) and negative outcomes (NO). Demographic, personal and environmental data were also collected. Results: The MMSE score was a significant negative predictor for KRAWS-NH overall and subscales except for EB; while age, PADL and history of falls were positive predictors for SD and NO. Total number of residents in a room was a significant negative predictor for EB and AS. Conclusion: Different factors found in PWDs may contribute to different aspects of wandering behaviour. Further studies on factors influencing multiple facets of wandering in various cultural settings are warranted.","[Song, Jun-Ah] Korea Univ, Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Young Mi] Yonsei Univ, Dept Nursing, Wonju Coll Med, Seoul, Kangwondo, South Korea; [Hong, Gwi-Ryung Son] Hanyang Univ, Dept Nursing, Coll Med, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Korea University; Yonsei University; Hanyang University,"Song, JA (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea.",jasong@korea.ac.kr,,"Song, Jun-Ah/0000-0002-2736-4037; Hong, Gwi-Ryung/0000-0001-7460-4972",Center on Frail and Vulnerable Elders (COFVE); University of Michigan School of Nursing,Center on Frail and Vulnerable Elders (COFVE); University of Michigan School of Nursing(University of Michigan System),"This study was partially supported by the pilot grant awarded to Dr Gwi-Ryung Son Hong from the Center on Frail and Vulnerable Elders (COFVE), University of Michigan School of Nursing.",,35,9,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-7863,1364-6915,,AGING MENT HEALTH,Aging Ment.

This study presents the first attempt to examine the reliability and validity of the TEMPS-A in Korea. Methods A total of 540 non-clinical participants completed the Korean TEMPS-A, which was adapted from the original English version via a comprehensive translation procedure. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and associations between temperaments were examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed, and differences in TEMPS-A scores between the gender- and age-based groups were examined using Kruskal-Wallis analysis.Results The Korean TEMPS-A exhibited excellent internal consistency (0.70-0.91) and significant correlations between subscales. EFA resulted in a two-factor structure: Factor I (depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious) and Factor II (hyperthymic). Gender and age group differences were observed. Conclusion Overall, our results suggest that TEMPS-A is a reliable and valid measure of affective temperaments for the Korean population. This study opens new possibilities for further research on affective temperaments and their related traits.","[Yu, Hyeona; Yoon, Joohyun; Lee, Chan Woo; Park, Ji Yoon; Jang, Yoonjeong; Park, Yun Seong; Ryoo, Hyun A.; Cho, Nayoung; Oh, Sunghee; Ha, Tae Hyon; Myung, Woojae] Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Dept Neuropsychiat, Seongnam, South Korea; [Kim, Won] Inje Univ, Sanggye Paik Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Woo, Jong-Min] Seoul Mental Hlth Clin, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Hyo Shin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychol, Daegu, South Korea; [Ha, Tae Hyon; Myung, Woojae] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Ha, Tae Hyon; Myung, Woojae] Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Neuropsychiat, 82 Gumi Ro 173beon Gil, Seongnam 13620, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Inje University; Kyungpook National University (KNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Ha, TH; Myung, W (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Neuropsychiat, 82 Gumi Ro 173beon Gil, Seongnam 13620, South Korea.",hatti@snu.ac.kr; wmyung@snu.ac.kr,"; Ha, Tae/U-5558-2019; Myung, Woojae/AAD-3016-2021; Park, Christopher/L-6074-2017; Jang, Yoonjeong/LKN-3419-2024; Woo, Jong/D-2353-2014","Park, Ji Yoon/0000-0002-6528-648X; Yoon, Joohyun/0000-0002-5350-9623; Yu, Hyeona/0000-0002-1070-1092; Park, Yunseong/0000-0003-1228-4250; Lee, Chan Woo/0000-0003-0332-4468; Kim, Won/0000-0002-5478-7350","SNUBH Research Fund [09- 2020-003]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea Grant - Korean government [NRF-2021R1A2C4001779]; KorKorea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health and Welfare, South Korea [HI19C0416]","SNUBH Research Fund; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea Grant - Korean government(National Research Foundation of Korea); KorKorea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health and Welfare, South Korea","This work was supported by the SNUBH Research Fund (grant no. 09- 2020-003; WM) .

Here, we ask whether listeners can perceive the intended honorific level of Korean utterances even in the absence of explicit verbal markers, and whether these phonetic cues are available cross-linguistically. We carried out two perception experiments with Korean listeners and also English listeners with no knowledge of Korean. In Experiment 1, stimuli from multiple voices were presented at random and participants had to judge the intended honorific level of isolated stimuli. Overall accuracies were low (58% for Koreans; 53% for English listeners). In Experiment 2, we blocked the presentation of different voices and asked participants to compare honorific and non-honorific speech from the same voice. Accuracies increased to 70% for Koreans and 57% for English listeners, indicating that speech acoustics become an important cue for politeness-related meanings when listeners can compare utterances produced by the same speaker. Our work shows that politeness does not merely reside in verbal markers but is co-signaled by phonetic cues. And, because the English listeners performed above chance on Experiment 2, the results suggest that some acoustic correlates of politeness may be understood in similar ways across cultures.

We make this argument on the basis of an experimental study where the subjects were asked to judge the grammaticality of sentences with long-distance bound caki-casin and to choose between the strict and sloppy readings in contexts of ellipsis/proform. A majority of subjects accepted long-distance bound caki-casin and preferred strict readings, indicating that long-distance bound caki-casin is behaving as an exempt anaphor. Speakers who accepted sentences with long-distance bound caki-casin were sensitive to logophoric factors that are known to influence exempt binding. These results imply that the core vs. exempt binding distinction (Pollard and Sag, 1992, 1994; Reinhart and Reuland, 1993) exists even in languages like Korean with a rich inventory of anaphors-local and long-distance-suggesting that the core-exempt dichotomy is orthogonal to the local vs. long-distance property of anaphors (Cole et al., 2001; Huang and Liu, 2001). More generally, the results indicate that both grammar and the interfaces are involved in anaphor binding. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

They valued (1) the focus on KCD diseases that are frequently seen in clinical practice and (2) the readjustment and introduction of the clinical skills test. They also emphasized KCD-related knowledge and skills for the assessment and diagnosis of KCD diseases, especially those frequently treated at primary healthcare institutes. We confirmed the generation gap in the subgroup analysis according to the license acquisition period, and the & LE;5-year group emphasized clinical practice and the KCD, while the >5-year group stressed traditional KM theory and clinical practice guidelines. These findings could be used to develop the NLE-KMD by setting the direction of Korean medicine education and guiding further research from other perspectives.","[Cho, Han-Byul] Dongguk Univ, Coll Korean Med, Grad Sch, Dept Neuropsychiat, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Sung, Won-Suk; Kim, Eun-Jung] Dongguk Univ, Bundang Oriental Hosp, Dept Acupuncture & Moxibust, Seongnam 13601, South Korea; [Hong, Jiseong] 7 Days Inc, Teaching & Learning, Seoul 06247, South Korea; [Kang, Yeonseok] Wonkwang Univ, Coll Korean Med, Dept Med Hist, Iksan Si 54538, South Korea",Dongguk University; Dongguk University; Wonkwang University,"Kim, EJ (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Bundang Oriental Hosp, Dept Acupuncture & Moxibust, Seongnam 13601, South Korea.",hanijjung@dumc.or.kr,,"Sung, Won-Suk/0000-0003-0585-9693",,,,,40,0,0,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9032,,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,JUN,2023,11,12,,,,,,,1685,10.3390/healthcare11121685,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11121685,,,13,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,K2WP8,37372803,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-07-11,WOS:001015097700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In examining the recent trend in trade and investment flows, this study sheds light on the high degree of North Korea's economic reliance on China, and the effects that the growth of the latter and its strong demand for low-cost resources and labor have had on North Korea. The principal finding of the article is the contradictory nature of current Sino-North Korean economic ties as China expands its dominance in the midst of North Korea's greater international isolation following its nuclear standoff. This contradiction is a reflection of China's renewed economic interest in North Korea as the cornerstone of its grand policy of reaching out to secure access to natural resources, transport infrastructure and markets. China's economic engagement carries with it benefits for North Korean regime survival, but also contains a potential development risk for the country associated with its economic dependency. In this regard, the emerging challenge to North Korea is the question of how to manage the adverse consequences of deepening economic relations with China.",,,,,,"Lee, Jong-Woon/0000-0002-9640-0281",,,,,25,2,2,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-4657,1976-5118,,PAC FOCUS,Pac.

However, coexisting with others entails challenges, especially when there are tremendous cultural differences, as with South Korean youth and North Korean youth defectors. Therefore, this phenomenological study investigates how the two groups of adolescents-two South Korean teenagers and six young North Korean defectors-from conflicting cultural backgrounds learned to coexist through a community-based art therapy project. Together, they completed a symbolic collaborative artwork called The Village-Making Project in a semester-long afterschool program. As a result, the participants' lived experiences were categorized into three themes and seven subthemes to show related phenomena: (a) looking at the familiar self from a new perspective, (b) understanding others by defining myself, and (c) developing We through coordination and reconciliation. The researchers discuss the meaning of community from an existential standpoint and the therapeutic role of the arts in helping community members coexist.","[Kim, Yuri; Park, Sojung] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Integrated Art Therapy, Grad Sch, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil,ECC B107, Seoul 03760, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Park, S (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Integrated Art Therapy, Grad Sch, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil,ECC B107, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",csnn@ewha.ac.kr,"; Gim, Yuri/JNZ-3445-2023","Park, Sojung/0000-0002-4731-5048;",,,,,66,2,2,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0197-4556,1873-5878,,ART PSYCHOTHER,Arts Psychother.,NOV,2021,76,,,,,,,,101860,10.1016/j.aip.2021.101860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2021.101860,,OCT 2021,12,"Psychology, Clinical; Rehabilitation",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Rehabilitation,WW8RY,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000718177900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To extend the model of Korean morphological processing, this study examined within-scriptal (Hangul-Hangul prime-target pairs) and cross-scriptal (Hanja-Hangul prime-target pairs) priming effects on the recognition of Sino-Korean compound words in Hangul as a function of adult readers' Hanja proficiency using priming lexical decision tasks. Experiment 1 (n = 54) examined the constituent morphemic effects of Hangul and Hanja primes, while Experiment 2 (n = 67) investigated morphemic decomposition in Hangul and Hanja primes. Participants with skilled Hanja proficiency showed robust constituent morphemic effects with both Hangul and Hanja primes in isolation, while less-skilled participants did not show the effects with Hangul and Hanja primes (Experiment 1). The skilled group showed efficient morphological decomposition in both within- and cross-script conditions. However, the less-skilled group did not show morphological effects in the cross-script condition but the same effect in the within-script condition (Experiment 2). The skilled group showed ortho-phonological inhibitory effects on Hangul recognition resulting from competitions among activated neighbors, but the less-skilled counterpart did not show the effect. Based on the findings of this study, two differing pathway models of morphological processing in Hangul are proposed for readers with different Hanja proficiency. Morphological processing in Sino-Korean compound words seems to be prelexical for skilled readers, whereas it is postlexical for less-skilled readers.","[Bae, Sungbong; Yi, Kwangoh] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Psychol, Kyungsan, South Korea; [Pae, Hye K.] Univ Cincinnati, Sch Educ, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",Yeungnam University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Yi, K (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Psychol, Kyungsan, South Korea.;Pae, HK (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Sch Educ, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",hye.pae@uc.edu; yiko@yu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5B5A16083065],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5B5A16083065).,,36,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-4777,1573-0905,,READ WRIT,Read.

This study argues that Manchukuo's bureaucratic recruitment and training processes molded civil officials into a paramilitary force, dedicated to developmentalism and a radical belief in the transformative power of the state. It approaches the institutional and cultural development of the Manchukuo bureaucracy as an evolutionary process. As pan-Asian radicals, military officials, and reform bureaucrats competed for control of Japan's imperial project, their ideas and agendas merged into a hybrid system of bureaucratic management that served as a model for the wartime empire. Looking past the temporal juncture of August 1945, this study also foregrounds the legacy of the Manchukuo bureaucracy on postwar East Asia. Manchukuo's government institutions recruited and indoctrinated not just Japanese but Korean, Taiwanese, and other imperial subjects in the name of ethnic harmony. Back in their homelands, these men adapted to their experience and training into the foundations of developmental nationalism and authoritarian state structures during the Cold War.","[Siverson, Rolf I.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Siverson, RI (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",siverson@sas.upenn.edu,"Siverson, Rolf/AGP-8855-2022","Siverson, Rolf/0000-0003-0455-1355",Korea Foundation; Academy of Korean Studies; Japan Foundation,Korea Foundation; Academy of Korean Studies; Japan Foundation,"Field research for this article was supported by the Korea Foundation, Academy of Korean Studies, and the Japan Foundation.",,55,2,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1479-5914,1479-5922,,INT J ASIAN STUD,Int.

While power is stably and reliably supplied in South Korea, North Korea (NK) is suffering from a severe power shortage. To improve power supply conditions in NK and ultimately contribute to building peace on the Korean Peninsula, the South Korean Government is considering assisting the construction of power plants and power grids in NK. The Government needs information about households' willingness to pay (WTP) for assisting the power supply to NK. This article aims to examine the WTP using a contingent valuation based on a nationwide survey of 1000 households. As a WTP elicitation method, the one-and-one-half-bounded question format of asking an interviewee whether she/he has the intention of paying a presented bid through an increase in electricity bills was adopted. The WTP for the assistance was statistically significantly estimated to be KRW 2382 (USD 2.12) per month per household.

J,"Gyung, YH",,,,"Gyung, Yi Hye",,,Changes in the Concept of Yulli during the Enlightenment Period in Korea,SEOUL JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gaehwagi (the enlightenment period of Korea); Korea (Joseon dynasty); Yulli; Ethics; Civilization,,"This article examines how the concept of yulli WI (ethics) was regarded during the modern period of enlightenment (Gaehwagi) in Korea. We first examine how the term yulli was employed in Japan, since it played a key role in transmitting to Korea the elements of modern Western civilization that it had already adopted; in addition, Japan shared the common traditions of Confucianism and Chinese characters with Korea. We can obtain a better understanding of the use of yulli in modern Korea by identifying the similarities and differences vis-A-vis its use in Japan. The use of yulli in pre-modern Korea is then considered. During the Joseon period, the term yulli referred to the objective principles of beings as well as the virtue of the mind in a Neo-Confucian context. This is then followed by a discussion of the semantic shift that the term yullihak iggi!V (a translated term for the Western concept of ethics imported from Japan) underwent during the modern period of enlightenment in Korea. Introduced as a discipline of modern Europe, yullihak allowed Korean intellectuals to perceive yulli as an element of civilization and take pride in the fact that this element of civilization had a long tradition in Korea. Finally, the way in which Korean intellectuals of the enlightenment period began to present the yulli of Korea as a distinctive and key strength of their nation is discussed. It is demonstrated that Korean intellectuals believed the reason Korea faced the loss of its sovereignty was not because it was a savage society, but because it had focused too much on the civilization of yulli to the detriment of a materialist civilization. Unlike the Japanese, this illustrates that Korean intellectuals did not differentiate between the ethics of modern Europe and pre-existing Neo-Confucianism ethics.","Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Gyung, YH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul 151, South Korea.",yhgyung@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,1,KYUJANGGAK INST KOREAN STUD,"SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU","NO 103, SAN 56-1, SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0201,,,SEOUL J KOREAN STUD,Seoul J.

This attack followed a year of mounting tensions in which Pyongyang tested the first stage of a long-range missile in the guise of putting a satellite into orbit and then conducted its second underground nuclear test. Following the attack, the Obama administration backed South Korea's decision to punish North Korea with tough trade sanctions. The author writes that this was not necessarily a wise move, as punitive measures, however justifiable, will be met tit-for-tat by North Korea. Pyongyang reacted to the July 2006 U.N. Security Council sanctions for its missile tests, the author writes, by conducting a nuclear test; its response to tougher U.N. sanctions in June 2009 for its second nuclear test was to reprocess more plutonium. The author looks at recent interactions, discussions, and disputes among North Korea, South Korea, and the United States, and writes that the only way to make the waters off Korea safer and to stop further nuclear proliferation is to resume the Six-Party Talks soon, negotiate in earnest, and start a parallel peace process for the Korea.",,,,,,,,,,,20,3,5,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0096-3402,,,B ATOM SCI,Bull.

J,"Park, J",,,,"Park, Junghyun",,,FRUSTRATED ALIGNMENT: THE PACIFIC PACT PROPOSALS FROM 1949 TO 1954 AND SOUTH KOREA-TAIWAN RELATIONS,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,South Korea; Taiwan; Cold War; the Pacific Pact; South Korea-Taiwan relations,,"This research deals with South Korea-Taiwan relations from 1949, when the concept of a Pacific Pact was first introduced, to 1954, when the Asian People's Anti-Communist League (APACL) was formed. Thus far, studies on the regional order of East Asia during the early Cold War period have focused on U.S. policies toward East Asia and U.S. relations with individual East Asian states. In contrast, this present work examines the multilateral nature of the international relations in the region at the time. The extended cooperation, conflict, and competition between South Korea (ROK) and Taiwan (ROC) over the Pacific Pact from 1949 to 1954 vividly show how actively the two nations attempted to engage in the international arena to ensure their own security. Certainly, the primary purpose of this pact was not to form an autonomous regional alliance independent of the United States. In post-World War II Asia, the United States sought to reorganize a new regional order in Asia, with Japan at the center of this proposed order. Under these circumstances, Taiwan and South Korea, standing at the front line of the Cold War, were desperate to attract the U.S.'s attention. Once the two new nations had secured U.S. military and economic aid, however, they no longer pursued their former aggressive and expansive diplomatic strategies. After the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, signed on December 2, 1954, Taiwan discarded the Pacific Pact as an offensive and defensive treaty and concentrated on the APACL. South Korea, for its part, did not further pursue the Pacific Pact after the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Agreement was concluded on October 1, 1953. South Korea and Taiwan maintained an exceptionally close relationship even after signing individual treaties with the United States. At times, the two nations competed to play a leading role in the international relations of Asia. Yet, their differences of opinion did not cross the line of cooperation between the two countries until the collapse of the Soviet Union brought an end to the Cold War system: South Korea then normalized relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1992.","Korea Univ, Asian Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Park, J (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Asian Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",jhpiao@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,29,9,11,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1479-5914,1479-5922,,INT J ASIAN STUD,Int.

Placing the period of 2012-2016 into historical context, it emphasizes that North Korea has consistently tried to hinder cooperation between South Korea and the other two Northeast Asian states by creating romantic triangles. North Korean propaganda frequently highlighted local territorial disputes, Japanese historical revisionism, and the deployment of US missile defense batteries in South Korea, but it could also abruptly remove these issues from its agenda if Pyongyang's foreign policy underwent a shift. Still, the DPRK was not necessarily able to benefit from these disagreements, because a Japan-ROK conflict could reinforce China-ROK cooperation (or vice versa). In periods of inter-Korean confrontation, Pyongyang had less chance to take advantage of Sino-Japanese and Japan-ROK friction than in periods of North-South rapprochement. If China or Japan decided to confront Seoul, they could easily have found alternative partners that were more powerful and attractive than the DPRK (like Russia or the United States), which limited their readiness to engage a confrontational North Korea.","[Szalontai, Balas] Korea Univ, Div Publ Sociol & Korean Unificat, Sejong Campus, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Szalontai, B (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Publ Sociol & Korean Unificat, Sejong Campus, Seoul, South Korea.",aoverl@yahoo.co.uk,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2925361]; Northeast Asian History Foundation Research Grant; Korea University's Industry-Academic Collaboration Office,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Northeast Asian History Foundation Research Grant; Korea University's Industry-Academic Collaboration Office","The preliminary stage of this research project, focused on the period 1965-1989 and completed in 2015, was supported by a Northeast Asian History Foundation Research Grant and Korea University's Industry-Academic Collaboration Office.

Chung received medical education at Charles University and practiced pathology in Czechoslovakia for eight years. Chung's life, however, ended tragically when he committed suicide. This study recounts the untold life story of Chung as well as his Korean American family. Reverend Hyun Soon, Chung's grandfather, was a nationalist movement leader. Alice Hyun, Chung's mother, was labeled Korean Mata Hari. This study argues that Chung was a son of the Korean independence movement who perished amidst the Cold War. The lives of his mother, grandfather, and uncles influenced Chung's life path. He joined political organizations, wrote essays, and organized fundraisers in support of North Korea, and wanted to return there after becoming a doctor. However, his mother was executed in North Korea around 1956 as an alleged U.S. intelligence spy. His uncles were summoned to the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee hearings and harassed with the threat of deportation. Chung himself lost his American citizenship. He had nowhere to return.

After discussing the regional and global implications that the success of this process might have, including its impact on the looming historical choice between substantially better and only superficially different alternatives to the reigning capitalist world-system, it takes up the third party's potential contribution to modern Asian thought, and ends with some cursory remarks on each word of the phrase: Asia, modernity, and thought.

The main purpose of the article is to suggest ways of mainstreaming the environmental aspect of security in international actions that engage with problematised countries like North Korea. A cross-cutting analysis is provided on the possible approaches - including environmental aid, extended or integral humanitarian exemption, and proactive ecological intervention - for the international community to be engaged in the field of environmental security under three different circumstances: peace, security alert and conflict.

Existing data show that Japanese settler women, as citizens of the metropole, reaped benefits in arenas such as lifestyle, education, occupation, and family life. Their status as women, however, simultaneously subjected them to strict patriarchal and conservative standards. While privileged as colonists, they were publicly marginalized and silenced by the peculiar dynamics created by colonialism and modernity. Based on in-depth interviews and personal memoirs, as well as official archives and statistics, this research examines the forms of modernity that Japanese women experienced in colonial Korea, highlighting both the benefits and constraints that the colonial context offered to the women.

Two research questions were developed to guide the study: (a) How are participants' ethnic identity perceptions as Korean Americans intertwined with their fanship to Hyun-Jin Ryu? and (b) How are participants' lived experiences intertwined with their fanship to Ryu? The study focused on the details of how fans perceived their ethnic identity in relation to Ryu's performance and presence in Major League Baseball. Findings revealed that fans initially became involved due to their ethnic ties to Ryu and remained as fans because they felt connected to the motherland of Korea. Fans individually identified with Ryu through the perceived minority status of being Korean American in the US. Fans experienced vicarious satisfaction as they felt Ryu broke racial, ethnic, and gender stereotypes through his body image and physical performance. Consequently, they developed Korean pride when Ryu performed well. This study extends Tajfel and Turner's social identity theory and Phinney's concept of ethnic identity to examine fanship to a specific player rather than a team.","[Shin, Na Ri; Peachey, Jon Welty; Park, Doo Jae] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Shin, NR (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Recreat Sport & Tourism, MC-584,1206 South Fourth St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",nshin2@illinois.edu,"Park, Doo Jae/HKM-9312-2023","Park, Doo Jae/0000-0001-5639-7965",,,,,61,7,7,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1012-6902,1461-7218,,INT REV SOCIOL SPORT,Int.

The purpose of this study was to translate CIS into Korean and evaluate the reliability and validity of a Korean version of CIS (K-CIS) for the Korean working age population. In the first experimentation of the study, four bilingual translators participated to translate CIS using a cross-cultural translation method. Then, a concurrent validity of K-CIS with the original CIS was evaluated by 28 bilingual participants. With a statistical analysis, it was confirmed that K-CIS and CIS were linguistically equivalent. In the second experimentation, 172 participants from various universities, industries, and small businesses assessed K-CIS along with two other representative fatigue questionnaires such as mKCFQ11 and SF-36. Our result of the statistical analysis using Cronbach's alpha, confirmatory factor analysis, inter-scale correlation, and correlation with other questionnaires showed that K-CIS was a valid fatigue questionnaire. Therefore, we conclude that K-CIS can be an effective tool to evaluate a severity of fatigue in the Korean working age population.","[Yang, Daeyong; Jung, Eui S.] Korea Univ, Dept Ind Management Engn, 145 Anam, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Jung, ES (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Ind Management Engn, 145 Anam, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",ejung@korea.ac.kr,"Yang, Daeyong/KFS-9064-2024","Yang, Daeyong/0000-0001-5408-6733",BK21 FOUR - Ministry of Education of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea,"BK21 FOUR - Ministry of Education of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",Acknowledgements This research was supported by the BK21 FOUR funded by the Ministry of Education of Korea and National Research Foundation of Korea.,,55,0,0,0,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-8141,1872-8219,,INT J IND ERGONOM,Int.

North Korea's Kim Jong Un, after consolidating his power base internally and with his nuclear and ICBM programs completed, has begun negotiations with President Donald Trump of the United States to guarantee his regime security. Although a reconciliatory atmosphere within inter-Korean relations continues cautiously after the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and the Panmunjom Inter-Korean Summit, many issues remain before tensions disappear from the Korean Peninsula. The U.S.-DPRK Summit in Singapore resulted in an overall direction of efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem. However, Korean people, well aware of North Korean behavior in the past, are in no hurry to predict its resolution. The trade war between the United States and China, being a global power struggle at its core, might become fiercer until it reaches climax. The Trump administration has ended sequestration-a legacy from the Obama administration-and significantly increased its defense budget, while slashing foreign aid and demanding that major allies, such as NATO member states and the ROK, take on a bigger burden of shared defense costs. The United States seeks to cement its superpower status for the future. China is undertaking some countermeasures, i.e., continued defense investments; a second sea trial for its aircraft carrier, which is a part of a wider program to acquire ten aircraft carriers by 2049; building military bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea; strengthening its economic and military partnership with Russia; and dramatically expanding its cyber forces. As the growth of Chinese military power has become a concern for countries in the region, the ROK confronts a particularly notable strategic dilemma. This is because inter-Korean relations, the ROK-U.S. alliance, and ROK-China relations are intricately overlapping in all areas. For the ROK, the security alliance with the United States continues to be a critical security asset.","[Ohm, Tae-am] Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea; [Ohm, Tae-am] Korea Inst Def Anal, US Studies Div, Seoul, South Korea; [Ohm, Tae-am] Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea",,"Ohm, TA (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Seoul, South Korea.;Ohm, TA (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, US Studies Div, Seoul, South Korea.;Ohm, TA (corresponding author), Korea Inst Def Anal, Ctr Secur & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea.",ota108@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,2,30,KOREA INST DEFENSE ANALYSES-KIDA,SEOUL,"37 HOEGI-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-871, SOUTH KOREA",1016-3271,1941-4641,,KOREAN J DEF ANAL,Korean J.

It started broadcasting in 1954 and served as an important source of information for the South Korean population during the early decades of the new nation. Though it was a Christian station, HLKY's programming was not limited to religious topics; it devoted airtime to world news, dramas, music, and general educational programing. HLKY occupies an important place in the history of radio broadcasting in South Korea, but its origins and planning are still poorly understood. Drawing on heretofore largely unexamined archival sources, this article details the establishment of HLKY. Particular attention is paid to the missionaries who, under the aegis of the Foreign Missionary Conference of North America (FMCNA), led the planning and early administration of the station. The founding of HLKY reflected both struggles among the major mission societies to maintain ecumenical cooperation in the face of theological fissures and a desire to cultivate a form of Christianity that could address, in a practical manner, the social and economic decay that were pervasive around the globe in the post-World War II period.","[Cha, Paul S.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Modern Languages & Cultures, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Cha, PS (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Sch Modern Languages & Cultures, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pcha@hku.hk,,"Cha, Sung Kwang/0000-0002-5619-4946",,,,,52,0,0,0,3,ACAD KOREAN STUDIES,GYEONGGI-DO,"323 HAOGAE-RO BUNDANG-GU SEONGNAM-SI, GYEONGGI-DO, 13455, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2020,60,4,,,,,143,168,,10.25024/kj.2020.60.4.143,http://dx.doi.org/10.25024/kj.2020.60.4.143,,,26,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,PX1AJ,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000611095700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite these new approaches, polemic that the colonial modernity thesis instigates, and the inspiration some intellectuals have derived from these, the term 'colonial modernity' has not been embraced by the Korean academy. This study explores this ambivalence, rather than dismissing negative responses as nationalist, because this scholarly ambivalence reveals the ontological dilemma inherent in the study or consideration of South Korea's colonial past. The author contends that this dilemma is not simply a matter of how to accept or reject the colonial modernity thesis; rather, it derives both from Korean scholars' inextricable location within the legacy of Korea's colonial wounds, and from Korean academy's awareness of its marginality and lack of voice in the global academic regime.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Cho, Y (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,,"Cho, Younghan/0000-0003-0785-5573",,,,,56,13,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0950-2386,,,CULT STUD,Cult.

Contributing to recent studies that have proposed -ta's functions in discourse, this study examines -ta's different boundary tones and argues that they allow speakers to perform different social actions in naturally occurring conversation. Based upon conversation analysis of video- and audio-recorded conversations, this article demonstrates that speakers, by using -ta in a high boundary tone, display the conveyed information as announceable and newsworthy, thereby highlighting newness of the information. Due to these characteristics, -ta utterances are overwhelmingly found in pre-telling sequences in which speakers announce news and within telling sequences in which speakers provide information that they believe is tellable for the development of a telling. By taking into account a boundary tone mapped onto a specific sentence-ender and analyzing in detail naturally occurring interaction with access to non-verbal interaction, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of prosody and interaction.

First, some female writers discuss Japanese women's heterosexual desire for Chinese and Korean men by emphasising these men's physicality and desirable masculinity. Second, Japanese novelists often assign hypermasculine language to Chinese and Korean male characters. By celebrating Chinese and Korean masculinity, such depictions offer a counternarrative to derogatory stereotypes that have circulated and continue to circulate in rightwing (often male) nationalistic discourses. At the same time, however, the language these writers employ otherises Chinese and Korean men by hypersexualising them and placing them outside mainstream Japanese society.","[Suzuki, Satoko] Macalester Coll, Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Macalester College,"Suzuki, S (corresponding author), Macalester Coll, Dept Asian Languages & Cultures, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",suzuki@macalester.edu,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,12,EQUINOX PUBLISHING LTD,SHEFFIELD,"415, THE WORKSTATION, 15 PATERNOSTER ROW, SHEFFIELD, S1 2BX, ENGLAND",1747-6321,1747-633X,,GENDER LANG,Gend.

In December 1951, Pang Hwa-il died from injuries sustained at the hands of four American soldiers during a late-night search of a home he was visiting. Many acts of violence perpetrated by the US military against Korean civilians like Pang during the Korean War went unaccounted for. However, his death would receive public attention in the United States because he was the associate general secretary of the Korean National Council of Churches. Responding to public pressure, the US military eventually started an investigation approximately two months after the incident took place. By examining the circumstances surrounding Pang's murder, the subsequent trial, and its aftermath, this article challenges a standard characterization of the relationship among missionaries, Korean Protestants, and the US military during the 1950s as a close partnership. The American government, the military, and missionaries had all carefully cultivated a narrative that the US and a Christian South Korea were allies against communism. However, Pang, a Korean Christian leader, was killed by a US soldier, not a communist enemy. Furthermore, the US military's initial delay in bringing Pang's assailants to trial and the light sentence that was handed down shocked both Korean and American observers. As this incident reveals, the US military valued the lives of its Korean allies less than American lives, calling into question the American government's claims that it was working in partnership with South Koreans.","[Cha, Paul S.] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Cha, PS (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pcha@hku.hk,,"Cha, Sung Kwang/0000-0002-5619-4946",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [17600721],Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),Research funding for this article was provided by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (General Research Fund Project # 17600721).,,55,0,0,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0009-6407,1755-2613,,CHURCH HIST,Church Hist.,SEP,2023,92,3,,,,,626,642,,10.1017/S0009640723002111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0009640723002111,,,17,History; Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History; Religion,CB6Y4,,hybrid,,,2025-07-11,WOS:001122842300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results show that: (1) The hawkish tendency in the presidents' attitudes has a certain relationship with North Korea's grain production. However, dove tendency is related to grain yield and its fluctuation rate, and the impact of the rate on the dove stance is even greater than the impact of production. (2) When North Korea's grain production increases, the presidents' stance on North Korea's policy tends to be tough; but when its grain production decreases, the presidents' attitudes towards North Korea will become relatively moderate. (3) The fluctuation rate of grain production in North Korea will affect the dove tendency of the presidents. Their stance will be more moderate if the rate decrease. But if the rate rises, the moderation of the statements will retreat.","[He, Jun; Yuan, Guanghui; Zhang, Chi] Shanghai Univ Polit Sci & Law, Ctr Polit & Social Secur Studies, Shanghai 201701, Peoples R China; [He, Jun] Shanghai Res Ctr Students Safety Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuaiwu] East China Normal Univ, Sch Adv Int & Area Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Political Science & Law; East China Normal University,"Zhang, C (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Polit Sci & Law, Ctr Polit & Social Secur Studies, Shanghai 201701, Peoples R China.",12110170023@fudan.edu.cn,"He, Jun/G-6601-2016",,National Social Science Fund of China [20CGJ033],National Social Science Fund of China,"This research was funded by The National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 20CGJ033.",,43,1,1,1,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

In doing this, this paper deals with four research questions: 1) How serious are North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities?; 2) What are the implications of international sanctions and countries' positions?; 3) Can and will South Korea and the international community stop the North Korean nuclear program successfully?; and 4) And if not, what should South Korea do? This paper indicates that in the wake of North Korea's fourth nuclear test and subsequent missile test, North Korea's nuclear Pandora's Box is almost about to open. It urges that if it indeed opens, it would completely change the strategic environment of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. This deep frustration and a sense of urgency have driven South Korea and the international community to impose stronger and tougher sanctions against North Korea than before. However, this paper argues that multiple factors-South Korea's limited ability; the escalation of the U.S.-China global and regional rivalry; the strategic consideration of countries involved, especially China; and North Korea's tenacious survival strategy-engage in strong pessimism, leaving the North Korean nuclear situation unresolved. Therefore, on the one hand, South Korea has to make every effort to denuclearize North Korea until the last minute, exhausting every possible option and means. However, on the other hand, it has to prepare for a worst-case scenario. This paper points out that South Korea's exit strategy should be a strategy of delicate deterrence that is a comprehensive strategy of deterrence to combine military, political and diplomatic means.","[Hyun, In-Taek] Korea Univ, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Hyun, IT (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea.",ithyun@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea University,Korea University,"The author would like to thank Korea University for its financial support that made this study possible.

Under the Lee Myung-bak administration, much of the progress in South Korean democracy since 1987 has been either interrupted or reversed. Yet such a reversal actually represents a consistent and long-standing pursuit on the part of anti-democratic forces with deep roots in Korea's division system. The division of the peninsula was consolidated into a kind of system with considerable powers of self-reproduction when the Korean War ended in a stalemate in 1953 and the armistice agreement was never replaced by a peace treaty. The result is an inherently anti-democratic political regime on either side. Democratization in the South did render a blow to, but did not abolish, this peninsula-wide system, so that anti-democratic forces have remained potent under the 1987 regime and even succeeded in regaining political power in 2008 (under Lee Myung-bak). The idea of a 2013 regime is to accomplish, when the change of administration occurs in early 2013, a change as momentous as in 1987, which may pave the way for the overcoming of the division system itself. The essay concludes with some theoretical reflections on democracy as people's self-rule.","[Paik, Nak-chung] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Paik, NC (corresponding author), 3-5 Hyochang Dong 801, Seoul 140897, South Korea.",,,,,,,,7,14,17,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1464-9373,,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

We investigated factors associated with the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among HIV-infected patients in Korea. A total of 840 HIV-infected patients who participated in the Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study from 2006 to 2012 were evaluated. Socio-demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical variables were obtained through standardized questionnaires. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory were used to assess the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among HIV-infected patients was 32% and 36%, respectively. Ex-smoker and persistent symptoms for more than one week within the past six months and diagnosis of HIV infection within one year were associated with increased anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-2.69; OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09-2.11; OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02-2.20) and current smoking and persistent symptoms were also associated with increased depressive symptoms (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31-3.30; OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.25-2.79). Marital status, current smoking, current drinking, and persistent symptoms were associated with both increased anxiety and depressive symptoms (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.07-2.88; OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.61; OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.99). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among HIV-infected patients is higher than those estimated for the general population. This study shows the necessity to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression and suggest psychological support for HIV-infected patients who smoke or have persistent symptoms or have sexual partner or drink.","[Kee, Mee-Kyung; Lee, Sae-Young; Kim, Na-Young; Kim, Sung Soon] Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Div Aids, Ctr Immunol & Pathol, Chungbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Joo-Shil] Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Chungbuk, South Korea; [Kim, June Myung; Choi, Jun Yong; Ku, Nam Su] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, June Myung; Choi, Jun Yong; Ku, Nam Su] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, AIDS Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Moon Won] Catholic Univ Korea, Seoul St Marys Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Dept Internal Med,Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Min Ja; Song, Joon Young] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, Seoul 136705, South Korea; [Woo, Jun Hee] Univ Ulsan, Dept Infect Dis, Asan Med Ctr, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Shin-Woo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Daegu, South Korea; [Baek, Ji-Hyeon] Inha Univ, Dept Internal Med, Sch Med, Inchon, South Korea; [Choi, Bo Youl] Hanyang Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency (KDCA); Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH); Korea CDC Center for Immunology & Pathology; Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency (KDCA); Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH); Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Seoul St. Mary's Hospital; Catholic University of Korea; Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center; Kyungpook National University (KNU); Inha University; Hanyang University,"Kim, SS (corresponding author), Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Div Aids, Ctr Immunol & Pathol, Chungbuk, South Korea.",sungskim63@gmail.com,"Kim, Jung/S-5543-2017; Kim, Ji Hwan/JKJ-3785-2023; Kim, Seong Cheol/ABD-1493-2022; Kim, Sun/G-3451-2013; Choi, Jah/AAA-4835-2022; Kim, Nam-Joong/J-2735-2012","Ku, Nam Su/0000-0002-9717-4327; Song, Joon Young/0000-0002-0148-7194; Kim, Shin-Woo/0000-0002-3755-8249; Choi, Jun Yong/0000-0002-2775-3315; KIM, MIN JA/0000-0002-2125-7521;",Chronic Infectious Disease Cohort Study (Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study) [2012E5100400]; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [4800-4859-304260],Chronic Infectious Disease Cohort Study (Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study); Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,This study was supported by a grant for the Chronic Infectious Disease Cohort Study (Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study [grant number 2012E5100400] and [grant number 4800-4859-304260]) from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,,39,24,28,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-0121,1360-0451,,AIDS CARE,Aids Care-Psychol.

Does the nature of inter-Korean relations affect the types of regionalism sought by South Korean governments? To address these questions, I examine the scope and priorities of the regional initiatives led by the four South Korean presidents in the past two decades.

Next, it proposes four theoretical considerations in the hope that they may lend common ground to those doing research on everyday politics in North Korea and facilitate more theoretically informed discussion. Researchers can use these areas - socialisation, surveillance, survival, and support - to situate their analyses more theoretically as they assess everyday politics in the DPRK.

As an extreme form of political conflict political polarization is characterized by antagonistic and divisive effects on politics and society. In South Korea, political polarization is not only negatively affecting its democracy in general but also inhibiting domestic consensus on rapprochement and reconciliation towards North Korea in particular. This is reflected in depicting political polarization as namnamgaldung or South-South conflict referring to two 'Souths' - progressives and rightist-conservatives - polarized in their position regarding how to deal with North Korea. Based on the empirical analysis of newspaper editorials in 2016 this article argues that a partisan framing of South-South conflict in the media is contributing to what the term supposedly is purely describing - political polarization.","[Mosler, Hannes B.; Chang, Hee Kyoung] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Mosler, HB (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",hannes.mosler@fu-berlin.de; chang.heekyoung@fu-berlin.de,"; Mosler, Hannes/AAJ-6616-2021","Mosler, Hannes/0000-0001-9443-9177;",,,,,79,9,12,1,21,INST KOREAN STUDIES,SEOUL,"CPO BOX 3410, SEOUL, 100-364, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3919,,,KOREA OBS,Korea Obs.,FAL,2019,50,3,,,,,331,354,,10.29152/KOIKS.2019.50.3.331,http://dx.doi.org/10.29152/KOIKS.2019.50.3.331,,,24,Area Studies; International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; International Relations,JD4QM,,,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000489964500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the main objectives of this essay is to highlight the fact that the concepts of photography and photographic technology were not simply imported into Korea from the West, but were actively recoded in ways that responded to established cultural and political discourses of Korea, and intercultural dialogues between East Asian countries. Emphasising the discursive specificity of photography in Korea, I move beyond the familiar discourse of centre and periphery that has shaped the narrative of western globalisation. This article will be of interest to contemporary historians and theorists of photography who are seeking alternatives to Euro-American notions of photography and its history.","[Oh, Hye-ri] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist Art & Architecture, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Oh, HR (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist Art & Architecture, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",hyeri3652@gmail.com,,,,,,,111,5,7,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-7298,2150-7295,,HIST PHOTOGR,Hist.

It intends to understand the state of toothbrushing practices in South Korea, and to provide basic data for promoting toothbrushing practices. Data from the 5th, 6th, and 7th KNHANESs conducted by the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency each year was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Tableau version 2020.1 was used for the graphs and geographic information system (GIS). The significance level of alpha was set at 0.05 for testing. In all analyses, the complex sampling analysis method with stratification variables, cluster variables, and weights was applied, and the complex sample linear regression analysis. The average frequency of toothbrushing per day was higher in women for all the years; these women belonged to the age group under 65 and the employed group. The average frequency of toothbrushing per day was lower in the married, elementary school graduate, part-time job, and low-income groups for all years. The demographic and social factors affecting the number of toothbrushing practices per day were gender, education level, income level, and work type. After analyzing the average frequency of toothbrushing per day in each of the cities and provinces, Gangwon-do and Jeonbuk showed the highest increase in the frequency of toothbrushing in 2018 compared to 2010, whereas Incheon showed the lowest increase. From the above results, the average frequency of toothbrushing per day was lower in males, those with a low education level, the unemployed, and those in the rural area for a period of 9 years. Therefore, in-depth oral health promotion projects and national benefit policies should be considered for effective toothbrushing education by identifying individuals who do not brush their teeth.","[Kim, Yu-Rin; Kang, Hyun-Kyung] Silla Univ, Dept Dent Hyg, 140 Baegyang Daero,700 Beon Gil, Busan 46958, South Korea",Silla University,"Kang, HK (corresponding author), Silla Univ, Dept Dent Hyg, 140 Baegyang Daero,700 Beon Gil, Busan 46958, South Korea.",dbfls1712@hanmail.net; kanghk75@gmail.com,"Kang, Hyun/AAE-7892-2020","Kim, Yu-Rin/0000-0001-6440-6745; Kang, Hyun-Kyung/0000-0001-5550-241X",,,,,20,8,8,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Faced with the contradictory understandings, this study examines whether technological standardisation and industry classification could increase innovations of an industry. Using ISO9001 and the SIC codes in Korea from 1998 to 2010, the empirical tests illustrate inverted U-shaped relationships between industry-level innovation and standardisation/classification. Therefore, it is suggested that a moderate degree of standardisation and classification provides a positive infrastructure for innovation by providing the necessary guidelines for a firm's behaviour as well as maintaining its flexibility.","[Rhee, Mooweon] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Park, Jin Suk] Univ Hawaii, Management & Ind Relat Dept, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Yoo, Taeyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; University of Hawaii System; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Yoo, T (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea.",taeyoungyoo@hufs.ac.kr,,"Park, Jin Suk/0000-0002-4453-6670",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2053799]; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [grant number NRF-2013S1A3A2053799] and by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund of 2015.,,58,1,2,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7325,1465-3990,,TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG,Technol.

Methods: From a nationwide sample of 18 hospitals in South Korea, 559 presenting patients with major depressive disorder were recruited. The DSM-IV based Structured Clinical Interview was administered for confirmatory diagnoses and depression subtypes with/without melancholic features. After baseline evaluation, they received naturalistic clinician-determined antidepressant interventions. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and re-evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. Results: At baseline, the 243 (43.5%) participants with melancholic features were more likely to have a previous history of depression, and had higher HAMA and lower SOFAS scores. After adjustment for baseline status, participants with melancholic features were more likely to achieve and to experience shorter times to CGI-s remission and associated with an enhanced global symptomatic remission with any antidepressant treatment. They were more likely to achieve and to experience shorter times to CGI-s remission and this difference was strongest in those receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants treatment. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: These findings suggest a faster and more evident global response to pharmacotherapy in melancholia compared to other depressive syndromes, particularly where SSRI agents are used.

The paper begins by defining network neutrality before discussing the technology underpinning network neutrality. It then contextualizes the issue in terms of policy, innovation, values, and society of Korean context. It compares the different approaches adopted by other countries to the regulation of network neutrality. Regulatory approaches to net neutrality can be either devising a comprehensive regulatory framework or abandoning the option of regulatory intervention altogether. We propose a careful combination of government intervention and market forces as a Korean model for allowing networks to remain a free and open marketplace of ideas and economic, political, and social interactions.

Findings - Segmentation by traditional K-means clustering was not judged useful, whereas segments generated by the innovative alternative of mixture regression modelling had clear marketing strategy potential. Research limitations/implications - Given the single-country and single-market context of the study, its outcomes and implications must be generalised cautiously. Practical implications - Mixture regression can make a significant contribution to the implementation of segmentation strategies based on deliverable consumer benefits, by helping academics and practitioners to better understand, explain and predict patterns of consumer behaviour.

The a-IIRS is a modified version of the original IIRS that measures illness-disruptions to daily life in patients with diverse diagnoses. While the psychometric properties of the original IIRS have been validated, no study has been conducted to validate the Korean version of a-IIRS. Methods After translation and back-translation processes, the Korean version of a-IIRS was developed. A pilot test was conducted with 10 patients with chronic diseases. A convenience sample of 380 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or arthritis was used. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, known-group technique, hypothesized relationships, internal consistency, and item analysis were tested. Results Three factors were extracted from principal components analysis with varimax rotation: Relationships and Personal Development, Instrumental Life, and Intimacy. Confirmatory factor analysis corroborated the good fit of the three-factor model. Illness intrusiveness was significantly different among the study subjects categorized into three groups according to different health status: poor, fair and good. The instrument was positively correlated with the scales of fatigue and depression. The tool demonstrated high internal consistency with adequate item-total correlations. Conclusions The findings are consistent with previous study results on IIRS and support the reliability and validity of the Korean version of a-IIRS. The instrument is culturally relevant for Korean patients with chronic diseases. Health care professionals need to consider illness intrusiveness when caring for patients with chronic diseases and promote their quality of life.

I consider a number of celebrity controversies to argue that the demands placed upon Hallyu celebrities by domestic observers, foreign audiences, and global capital are fundamentally irreconcilable. South Korean nationalist appropriation of Hallyu, as well as the local celebrity culture, demand that Hallyu stars firstly be exemplary Korean patriots, whereas international audiences expect sympathy for their own causes. Local nationalist agendas have proven particularly troublesome because of postcolonial sensibilities and ongoing territorial disagreements between South Korea and its neighbors. Finally, as circulating commodities and commercial assets, Hallyu stars are also pledged to global capital. Their value is highest when they appeal to as broad an audience as possible and alienate no one with their politics. An apolitical neutrality on regionally controversial issues, however, is an untenable position when antagonistic geopolitical interests are concerned and nationalist passions flare. I situate this argument within critical scholarship on cultural globalization flows within Asia, while engaging celebrity studies to frame Hallyu stars as transnational commodities.","[Fedorenko, Olga] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Anthropol, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Fedorenko, O (corresponding author), SNU, Coll Social Sci, Suite 404,Bldg 16,Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",olga.fedorenko@gmail.com,,"Fedorenko, Olga/0000-0002-1789-187X",,,,,75,26,27,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

We aimed to investigate the association between long working hours and unmet healthcare need. Methods We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys collected during 2007-2012, which included 8369 participants (4765 males, 3604 females) aged 20-54 years, who were paid workers. We used a logistic regression model with gender stratification to investigate the association between working hours and unmet healthcare need. Results Of the 8369 participants, 855 males (17.94%) and 981 females (27.22%) experienced unmet healthcare need. After adjusting for covariates, and compared to 30-39 working hours per week, the odds ratios (OR) of unmet healthcare need were 1.07 [(95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.76-1.51], 1.46 (95% CI 1.03-2.07), and 1.57 (95% CI 1.11-2.23) in males, and 1.13 (95% CI 0.92-1.40), 1.30 (95% CI 0.99-1.69), and 1.60 (95% CI 1.21-2.10) in females, for 40-49, 50-59, and >= 60 work hours per week, respectively. There was a dose response relationship between working hours per week and unmet healthcare need in both genders. Conclusions Those who work long hours are more likely to have unmet healthcare needs, the cause of which seems to be lack of time.","[Seok, Hongdeok; Won, Jong-Uk; Kim, Yeong-Kwang; Lee, Wanhyung; Lee, June-Hee; Roh, Jaehoon; Yoon, Jin-Ha] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul 120752, South Korea; [Seok, Hongdeok; Won, Jong-Uk; Kim, Yeong-Kwang; Lee, Wanhyung; Lee, June-Hee; Roh, Jaehoon; Yoon, Jin-Ha] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Inst Occupat Hlth, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120752, South Korea; [Won, Jong-Uk; Roh, Jaehoon; Yoon, Jin-Ha] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 120752, South Korea; [Won, Jong-Uk; Roh, Jaehoon; Yoon, Jin-Ha] Incheon Workers Hlth Ctr, Inchon, South Korea; [Lee, Tae Il] Inha Univ, Sch Med, Inchon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Inha University,"Yoon, JH (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Inst Occupat Hlth, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",flyinyou@gmail.com,"; Lee, Wanhyung/M-8739-2016; Lee, Tae Yoon/H-6596-2014","Won, Jong-Uk/0000-0002-9200-3297; Yoon, Jin-Ha/0000-0003-4198-2955;",,,,,52,24,24,0,11,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL WORK ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH,HELSINKI,"TOPELIUKSENKATU 41A, SF-00250 HELSINKI, FINLAND",0355-3140,1795-990X,,SCAND J WORK ENV HEA,Scand.

When it comes to the U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework from 1994 through 2002, previous research has paid scant attention to how the U.S. Congress responded to President Clinton's accord with the Pyongyang regime. This article provides a rare empirical assessment of what led America's lawmakers to uphold or overturn the executive agreements with North Korea. The bottom-line finding is that politics hardly stops at the water's edge, with politics-as-usual forces such as partisan conflicts ultimately having derailed Congressional commitments to the U.S.-DPRK accords. The results shed light on how and why domestic politics often redirects the course of international agreements, particularly in the era of polarized politics.","Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Seo, J (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",seojk@khu.ac.kr,"Seo, Jungkun/AAM-6968-2020",,Kyung Hee University [KHU-20121694]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2054311],Kyung Hee University; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"This study was supported by a grant from Kyung Hee University (KHU-20121694) and the National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2054311).

Method: In a cross-sectional survey, 1,344 fourth-grade primary school children completed a questionnaire on self-reported bullying and victimization behaviors, depression, anxiety, body image, coping strategies, and self-esteem as well as the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Parents completed a questionnaire on demographic data, the General Health Questionnaire-1 2, and the Korean version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of bullies, victims, and bullies/victims was 12.0%, 5.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. Boys were significantly more likely to be bullies and bullies/victims. In the multivariate analyses, bullying and victimization behaviors were associated with gender, greater than average height, higher depression, higher trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, and total difficulties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Differences in the associations were found between boys and girls. Conclusions: The authors found that bullying is common among South Korean primary school students and that bullying and victimization behaviors are related to various emotional, behavioral, and social problems; some gender-related differences are also evident.","Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Kwangju 501746, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 5 Hak Dong, Kwangju 501746, South Korea.",jsyoon@chonnam.ac.kr,"KIM, Jae-Min/S-7637-2019; shin, i/JCE-1227-2023",,,,,,50,95,120,3,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0890-8567,1527-5418,,J AM ACAD CHILD PSY,J.

Cerebrovascular disease may be an important aetiological factor for depression in the context of cognitive impairment but has received little investigation in population-based research. Objectives To investigate the association between vascular disease/risk and depression in an older Korean population with cognitive impairment. Methods The sample consisted of 341 persons, drawn from a community study in Kwangju, South Korea, all aged 65 or over and with scores of 24 or below on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), vascular disease/risk (interview, examination and blood tests), and disablement were ascertained. Results Previous stroke was associated with depression (Odds Ratio 3.4, 95% Confidence Intervals 1.6-7.4). This association was weaker in the presence of more severe cognitive impairment and higher levels of dependency. No associations were found between depression and any other measures of vascular risk. Conclusions In the absence of previous stroke, a role of vascular disease/risk was not supported in the aetiology late-life depression.

Moving to Australia, many migrant communities tend to shift from their heritage languages (HLs) and shift to English. Korean migrant communities, however, buck this trend. Notable within the Korean communities are ethnic church congregations, which offer social networks to maintain Korean identity. Focusing on the Korean communities in Australia, this study extends the limited knowledge about the potential of migrant religious organisations to promote HL maintenance. Specifically, drawing on data from 300 surveys collected from parents and semi-structured interviews with eight parents and their children, this study compares experiences of HL maintenance among families who attend a Korean church with those who do not. A key finding is that families affiliated with a Korean church are more likely to prioritise HL learning, practise the language and be proficient in the language than those who are not. Additionally, participants in this study reported that Korean churches provide valuable opportunities for HL learning. This study contributes to an understanding of the intertwined dynamics of migration, religion and language.","[Chik, Alice; Djonov, Emilia] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Joo, Sun Jung] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Educ, 29 Wallys Walk,Balaclava Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; Macquarie University,"Joo, SJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Educ, 29 Wallys Walk,Balaclava Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",sun.joo@mq.edu.au; alice.chik@mq.edu.au; emilia.djonov@mq.edu.au,"Djonov, Emilia/I-3046-2013","Djonov, Emilia/0000-0003-1593-6365; Joo, Sun Jung/0000-0001-7575-3347; Chik, Alice/0000-0002-5873-4731",,,,,63,2,2,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1868-6303,1868-6311,,APPL LINGUIST REV,Appl.

Occupational classes were categorized according to the Korean Standard Occupational Classification (KSOC). Hazard ratio adjusting age and diagnosed year were calculated for each occupation by cancer sites. Results: Men in service/sales and blue-collar occupations had lower survival of all cancer sites combined and esophagus, stomach, colorectal, liver, larynx, lung, prostate, thyroid cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than men in professional and managerial positions. Cancer sites with good prognosis like prostate cancer showed wider gap across occupational class. Conclusions: Considerable inequalities in cancer survival were found by occupation among Korean men.

Hence, it is important to clarify distinguishing features of lifetime attempters with a high level of current suicide risk for efficient preventive management. Methods: We compared characteristics of suicide attempts and clinical characteristics among high-, moderate-, and low-risk attempters. Among the total of 6022 participants in the Korean Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, 193 reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime, 36 of which had high, 126 moderate, and 30 low levels of current suicide risk (1 incomplete response). Results: High-risk suicide attempters had more past attempts compared with moderate- and low-risk suicide attempters. Suicide attempts were closely linked to a wide range of psychiatric comorbidities regardless of degree of current level of suicide risk, but the relative risk for having at least one mental disorder was the highest in high-risk attempters. Specifically, the relative risks for depressive disorder, anxiety disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders were higher in high-risk attempters, and relative risk for somatoform disorder was higher in low-risk attempters than others. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that special attention is required for suicide attempters with a history of repeated attempts and current mental disorders, particularly anxiety disorders.","[Park, Subin] Natl Ctr Mental Hlth, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Dept Res Planning, 127 Yongma Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Yeeun] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Youn, Tak] Dongguk Univ, Dept Psychiat, Ilsan Hosp, 27 Dongguk Ro, Goyang, South Korea; [Kim, Byung Soo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, 807 Hoguk Ro, Daegu, South Korea; [Park, Jong Ik] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, 156 Baengnyeong Ro, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Kim, Haesoo; Lee, Hyo Chu] Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Hong, Jin Pyo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Psychiat, Samsung Med Ctr, Sch Med, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea",Korea University; Dongguk University; NHIS Ilsan Hospital; Kyungpook National University (KNU); Kangwon National University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung Medical Center; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung Medical Center,"Hong, JP (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Psychiat, Samsung Med Ctr, Sch Med, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea.",suhurhong@gmail.com,"; Kim, Byung-Soo/H-4047-2013","Archer Lee, Yeeun/0000-0002-9565-2962;","Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare; Korea Healthcare Technology R&D project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI12C0035, HI15C1072]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) from the Korean Government (MSIP) [NRF-2014R1A1A3049818]","Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare(Ministry of Health & Welfare (MOHW), Republic of Korea); Korea Healthcare Technology R&D project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) from the Korean Government (MSIP)","This work was supported by the research grant from the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare and Korea Healthcare Technology R&D project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea [Grant number HI12C0035 and HI15C1072] and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant from the Korean Government (MSIP) [NRF-2014R1A1A3049818].

We studied the relationship between shift work and periodontitis in a representative sample of an Asian population. Methods Participants were 4597 full-time employees from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV). Shifting patterns were categorized into five shifts: daytime (N=3768), evening (N=121), night (N=59), rotating (N=206), and irregular (N=443). Periodontitis was measured with the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). Confounders included age, gender, income, and education. Mediators were frequency of daily tooth brushing, regular dental check-up, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, and white blood cell count. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship. Results The prevalence of periodontitis in the study population was 32.3%. Shift workers had an elevated odds ratio (OR) of periodontitis [OR 1.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01-1.48] after controlling for confounders. The magnitude of the association between shift work and periodontitis attenuated with adjustment of mediators (smoking and a marker of inflammation). In subgroup analyses, the association was significant (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.95) among those >= 45 years.

The study identifies six factors as having a clear influence on supporting nuclear power development: (1) strong state involvement in guiding economic development, (2) centralization of national energy policymaking and planning: (3) campaigns to link technological progress with national revitalization, (4) influence of technocratic ideology on policy decisions: (5) subordination of challenges to political authority, and (6) low levels of civic activism. The paper postulates that insights from this study can be used to assess the propensity of nations which have the emergent capacity to support nuclear power development to actually embark on such programs.

MethodsThe sample of 1,020 college students was stratified to reflect geographical differences among the students. The K-MDQ and an epidemiological survey were administered between November 2006 and February 2007. To validate the K-MDQ as a screening tool for BSD, the Korean version of the Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (K-BSDS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) were also administered. ResultsThe rates satisfying MDQ criterion 1, and all three MDQ criteria, were 55.5% and 2.3%, respectively. According to the K-BSDS, 59.9% of the sample met the criteria for BSD using a threshold of 10, while no statistical differences were observed among subgroups. When we examined the diagnostic agreement between K-MDQ and K-BSDS, 79.5% of students who met MDQ criterion 1 were also positive on the BSDS. Sixteen (21.6%) of the 74 students who participated in the SCID interview were diagnosed with BSD. DiscussionAlthough the K-MDQ is a useful tool to assess BSD among inpatients and outpatients, it does not appear useful as a screening tool to detect BSD among college students.","[Bae, Seung Oh] Gwangju Mirae Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kwangju, South Korea; [Kim, Moon Doo] Jeju Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Cheju, South Korea; [Lee, Jung Goo] Inje Univ Haeundae Paik Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Pusan, South Korea; [Lee, Jung Goo] Paik Inst Clin Res, Pusan, South Korea; [Seo, Jeong-Seok] Konkuk Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Chungju, South Korea; [Won, Seung-Hee] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Taegu, South Korea; [Woo, Young Sup; Bahk, Won Myong] Catholic Univ Korea, Yeouido St Marys Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Seok, Jeong-Ho; Kim, Se Joo] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Won] Inje Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Min, Kyung Joon] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Jon, Duk-In] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Anyang, South Korea; [Shin, Young Chul] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Bo-Hyun] Naju Natl Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Naju, South Korea",Jeju National University; Inje University; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Kyungpook National University (KNU); Catholic University of Korea; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Inje University; Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University Hospital; Hallym University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung Medical Center,"Bahk, WM (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Korea, Yeouido St Marys Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, 62 Yeouido Dong, Seoul 150713, South Korea.",wmbahk@catholic.ac.kr; yoonbh@chollian.net,"Min, Kyung/AAC-3624-2021; Lee, Jung/H-5563-2017; SEO, JEONG/AAM-7739-2021; Lee, Jung Goo/H-5563-2017; Yoon, Bo/H-6344-2011","Lee, Jung Goo/0000-0003-3393-2667; Seok, Jeong-Ho/0000-0002-9402-7591; KIM, SE JOO/0000-0002-5438-8210",Korean Neuropsychiatric Association,Korean Neuropsychiatric Association,This study was supported by the Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.,,30,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5864,1758-5872,,ASIA-PAC PSYCHIAT,Asia-Pac.

Analysis using waves 4 to 8 data of the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Family, with response rates ranging from 68.3% to 78.2%, indicates that gender discrimination in hiring, dismissal, promotion, job allocation, training, wage, and sexual harassment is strongly associated with suicidal thoughts among women. This relationship remains significant even after controlling for stress, depression, and other forms of discrimination. Subgroup analysis further highlights that women with lower income levels are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of gender discrimination. The findings underscore the importance of policy intervention to mitigate labor market discrimination against women as a crucial step in preventing suicides among Korean women.","[Chu, Youngmin] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Chu, YM (corresponding author), Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 130 Humphrey Sch 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",chu00119@umn.edu,,"Chu, Youngmin/0009-0003-3103-8431",Minnesota Population Center - Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [P2C HD041023],Minnesota Population Center - Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from Professor Christina Ewig and Professor Tom VanHeuvelen for developing research ideas and providing writing assistance, and Rachel Magennis at the Minnesota Population Center for proofreading.

This diglossic setting permitted a complex investigation of multiple elements, including L2-motivation theoretical attributes, exposure to Korean contemporary pop culture, and the linguistic and cultural diversity of the local community. 152 KFL university students completed an online survey. Participants were sorted into four language groups according to the degree to which English/Spanish predominated in their daily life: Spanish-dominant, balanced, and English-dominant bilinguals, in addition to English monolinguals. Maximum Likelihood Exploratory Factor Analysis found two underlying KFL motivation factors, which were conceptualised as a social-cultural factor (F1) and an educational factor (F2). This underlying motivation structure was then further explored to find associations between the factor-based motivational attributes and the four language groups. Repeated MANOVA measures found statistically significant interactional effects and between-group differences between the balanced and non-balanced bilingual groups and the English monolinguals. Further discussion highlights the diglossic environment, the cultural interests of bilingual young adults in L3 learning, and the role of English as a power language.","[Eom, Minhee] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Writing & Language Studies, Edinburg, TX USA; [Braithwaite, Jean] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Creat Writing & Writing & Language Studies, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Braithwaite, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Creat Writing & Writing & Language Studies, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",jeanbraithwaite@utrgv.edu,,,,,,,59,2,3,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1479-0718,1747-7530,,INT J MULTILING,Int.

J,"Choi, S",,,,"Choi, Soonja",,,Development of Clause Chaining in Korean,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Korean acquisition; clause chaining in Korean; topic continuity; anaphoric reference; acquisition of conjunction; event segmentation,GOAL,"Korean is a language with the verb at the end of a clause/sentence. In chaining several clauses [each consisting of a subject and a verb] in a sentence, a conjunction (e.g., -ko and then, -ese because, and so) is suffixed to the verb of a non-final clause. Korean has an extensive set of conjunctions that connect to the next clause, expressing temporal, causal, and contrastive relations among others. In this paper, I lay out a developmental trajectory of clause chaining construction in Korean based on longitudinal and cross-sectional data samples, focusing on conjunctive forms and functions as well as morphological and syntactic properties of connected clauses in a sentence. The database comes from longitudinal naturalistic speech data of five children collected regularly over different time periods between 2 and 5 years of age, and from elicited descriptions of short video events from children - aged 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years - and adults. The results show that, at least from 2 years of age, the Korean children in the sample start connecting clauses using appropriate conjunctions. Within 6 months, they acquire several major conjunctions that express temporal, causal, conditional, and contrastive relations between events. By 4 years of age, the children's clause chains are quite adult-like in terms of the repertoire of conjunctive forms and functions, and of the morphological and syntactic features of the clauses that connect to the main clause. In particular they learn to express temporal relations that have some disjuncture between events. However, 4-year-olds still lack the ability to appropriately refer to differential subjects of the chained clauses and also to connect multiple clauses in a sentence. The elicitation data reveal that further development in clause chaining occurs over several years - with a milestone at 10 years - and through adulthood, particularly in relation to appropriate referential marking, conjunction frequency, and segmentation of a macro event into sub-events for clause-chaining construction. These developmental processes are presented from a cognitive perspective, in particular with regard to concept of temporal relation, reference specification involving two or more entities, and perceptual saliency of event type.","[Choi, Soonja] San Diego State Univ, Dept Linguist & Asian Middle Eastern Languages, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Choi, S (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Linguist & Asian Middle Eastern Languages, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",schoi@sdsu.edu,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

We draw on constructivist literature that explores the biograph-ical parameters of national identity narratives and their sig-nificance in global politics to examine changing representa-tions of North Korea on South Korean screens. We analyze Crash Landing as a set of representations that mirror South Korea???s construction of Korean national identit(ies), with real-world, sociopolitical consequences. We argue that nos-talgic depictions of North Korea on screen situate it as the receptacle of a Korean past characterized by ruralness and intimate community life. In contrast, capitalist (post -)moder-nity is South Korea???s inescapable present, signifying its ma-terial victory over the North by virtue of its developmental successes. Finally, reunification is the future-oriented project that unites the divided biographical trajectories of both Ko-reas but remains materially elusive.","[Son, Sarah A.] Univ Sheffield, Korean Studies, Sch East Asian Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Schwak, Juliette] Franklin Univ Switzerland, Int Relat & Polit Sci, Sorengo, Switzerland",University of Sheffield; Franklin University Switzerland,"Son, SA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Korean Studies, Sch East Asian Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,"Schwak, Juliette/AAJ-7727-2021",,,,,,58,1,1,1,15,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0258-9184,2288-2871,,ASIAN PERSPECT-SEOUL,Asian Perspec.,,2022,46,3,,,,,501,521,,10.1353/apr.2022.0020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/apr.2022.0020,,,22,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,3R1VP,,Green Accepted,,,2025-07-11,WOS:000838708000005,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Soo-Hyun, M",,,,"Soo-Hyun, Mun",,,An Analysis of the Debate over Conscientious Objection in Korea,SEOUL JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Freedom of conscience; conscientious objection in Korea; formation of the individual in Korea,,"Although freedom of conscience, the legal foundation of conscientious objection, was incorporated into the South Korean Constitution in 1948, conscientious objection in Korea remained taboo until the late 1990s. The goal of this article is to illustrate how and why attitudes towards conscientious objection remained virtually unchanged in such a fast-moving society like that of Korea. Freedom of religion and conscience represent the central concepts of Western Constitutions and conscientious objection in the West is deeply rooted in the history of pacifist Christian churches there. However, Korean society had no ideological background or historical experience with respect to conscientious objection. The concept of conscientious objection was so foreign to the Korean people that there was no proper terminology for indicating such a notion; instead, terms such as jingjip geobu (refusal of conscription) or byeongyeok gipi (draft evasion) were used. Conscientious objection was perceived not as a human rights issue, but as a matter concerning a few particular Christian denominations, denominations largely deemed socially unacceptable by the Korean populace. In other words, the Korean debate on conscientious objection was framed as a confrontation between the Korean state and specific Christian denominations, particularly the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Seventh-Day Adventists, rather than as an issue of confrontation between individual citizens and the state. Only around 2000 were Korean conscientious objectors able to extricate themselves from such a narrow mindset. Since the late 1990s the determination made out of individual conscience to never kill another person or participate in war of any sort, has emerged as a meaningful and controversial issue. This change in the nation's collective consciousness may be summarized in terms of the formation of the individual. Not only have conscientious objectors begun to represent themselves as individuals, but South Korean society has also come to show sympathy with those individuals who have different ideas from the majority concerning military service and conscientious objection.","UNIST, Div Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Ulsan, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Soo-Hyun, M (corresponding author), UNIST, Div Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Ulsan, South Korea.",munshyun@unist.ac.kr,,,,,,,54,4,6,1,7,KYUJANGGAK INST KOREAN STUD,"SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU","NO 103, SAN 56-1, SHINRIMDONG, KWANAKGU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1225-0201,2331-4826,,SEOUL J KOREAN STUD,Seoul J.

The hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers serving in Korea were an almost ubiquitous presence in wartime North Korea. Yet the relationship between the volunteers and North Korean civilians has not been the subject of many studies. Memoirs written by the volunteers are one of the few sources that document these interactions. Among the subjects the volunteers wrote about, their encounters with older North Koreans whom they called mothers or omoni were among the most prominent. While acknowledging the propagandistic intent behind some of these memoirs, the article argues that they do shed light on some of the emotional norms that shaped relations between North Korean women and the volunteers even if they cannot always be treated as completely reliable descriptions of events.","[Brazinsky, Gregg A.] George Washington Univ, Hist & Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Brazinsky, GA (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Hist & Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,"Brazinsky, Gregg/0009-0003-5862-9290",Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2019-R15],Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies,This article was supported by the Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2019-R15).,,42,3,3,0,2,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0731-1613,2158-1665,,J KOREAN STUD,J.
